#### About Learn to Code

During these events, there will be a mixture of interactive workshops and
talks. We will be teaching you the basics of programming using
[Python](http://www.python.org/). These events are good if you have zero coding
experience, but they are also valuable if you already have started coding and
would like to better your skills. We also welcome people who already have good
coding experience as the more volunteers the better!

These events are always followed by our weekly
[[/events/tags/geek_night|Geek Night]].

You can find out more information about this series of events over at

We also have a facebook group for discussion if you are taking part in this
course: [fb.com/groups/OXLearnToCode](https://www.facebook.com/groups/OXLearnToCode/)

...and a group for those who would like to volunteer: [fb.com/groups/OXLearnToCodeHelpers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/OXLearnToCodeHelpers/)
