## The Goal of This Lesson



## Before we Start


### Introducing the `dict` type

#### Some examples using `dict`

### Intruducing Functions

#### How are they useful

#### Function Arguments

#### Functions have their own variables

(talk about function scope)

#### Changing variables outside a function (maybe?)

(this is less of a generic programming feature, using the `global` keyword)

## Let's Start Making a Game

### What is a Text-Based Adventure Game?

### Structuring the Game

* Which variables will we suggest using (string location, health etc) maybe
  putting user information into a dictionary.
* Using a while loop to continuously ask for input etc...

### A Starting Point

(using the above suggestions, a v. basic prompt in a loop)

(start if statements to handle different commands differently)

(introduce the idea of the `new_location(direction)` function)
