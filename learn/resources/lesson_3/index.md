## The Goal of This Lesson

In this lesson, we will be taking a little bit of a different approach. We will
be working towards the goal of creating a text based adventure game. There will
be less guidance, so that you can try and use the skills that you have learned
in the lessions so far.

We will give you tasks to complete, and tips, and helpers will be available to
answe any questions during the lesson.

## Before we Start

There are a couple more interesting things that we would like to teach you
before getting started...

### Introducing the `dict` type

#### Some examples using `dict`

### Intruducing Functions

#### How are they useful

#### Function Arguments

#### Talk about how they've been using them the whole time, and give examples

#### Functions have their own variables

(talk about function scope)

## Let's Start Making a Game

From this point onwards we want you to experiment as much as possible! Make
the game your own, create your own world and allow the user to interact with it
exactly as you like!

We will be making suggestions and giving ideas for you to try and implement,
but we encourage you to think of completely unique ideas and use your knowledge
so far to try and do them.

Lets create your first text-based adventure game!

### What is a Text-Based Adventure Game?

### Structuring the Game

* Which variables will we suggest using (string location, health etc) maybe
  putting user information into a dictionary.
* Using a while loop to continuously ask for input etc...

### A Starting Point

(using the above suggestions, a v. basic prompt in a loop)

(start if statements to handle different commands differently)

(introduce the idea of the `new_location(direction)` function)

### Tasks

Here are a selection of features you can try and add to your game. You don't
have to follow this list exactly, and are ancouraged to use your imagination!

#### Implement the `new_location()` function

(may want to reorder these, definitely want to add more)

#### Add lots of new locations, and experiment moving around in your game

#### Adding objects at locations

e.g:

* Chests

#### Interacting with objects

#### Adding Monsters into the mix
