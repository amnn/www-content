## The Goal of This Lesson



## Before we Start


### Introducing the `dict` type

#### Some examples using `dict`

### Intruducing Functions

#### How are they useful

#### Function Arguments

#### Talk about how they've been using them the whole time, and give examples

#### Functions have their own variables

(talk about function scope)

## Let's Start Making a Game

### What is a Text-Based Adventure Game?

### Structuring the Game

* Which variables will we suggest using (string location, health etc) maybe
  putting user information into a dictionary.
* Using a while loop to continuously ask for input etc...

### A Starting Point

(using the above suggestions, a v. basic prompt in a loop)

(start if statements to handle different commands differently)

(introduce the idea of the `new_location(direction)` function)

### Tasks

#### Implement the `new_location()` function

(may want to reorder these, definitely want to add more)

#### Add lots of new locations, and experiment moving around in your game

#### Adding objects at locations

e.g:

* Chests

#### Interacting with objects

#### Adding Monsters into the mix
