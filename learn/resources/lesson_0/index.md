[meta title="Lesson 0: Setting Up" /]

This page details what needs to be done before being able to get started with
the programming.

Throughout the course, we'll be using a text editor called
[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). We will show you how to use this
on the **lab computers**, and how to set it up on your laptops.

## How We'll Be Starting The Course

Initially, you will be using the computers available in the lab, so that you
can get stuck straight in. No setup or anything is required on these computers,
you can just follow the instructor / the online resources and be on your way.

  Your data on these <strong>lab computers</strong> will be
  <strong>deleted</strong>, you will be logged in on a temporary account.
  <br /><br />
  If you would like to save your progress before the end of the session, make
  sure you copy the files to a usb stick, or email them to yourself or
  something. A helper will be able to hwlp you do this if you get stuck.

After you have had some exposure to python and start to feel comfortable, we
will go through setting up your python development environment on your own
personal laptop, so that you will not need to use the **lab computers** to do
programming, (you could even do it outside of the course if you like).

## Setting Up your Python Development Environment on your Laptop

Firstly, download and install [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) (You
can use a different plaintext editor if you already have a favourite).

From here-on-out the instructions very depending on your operating system...

### Mac OS X

Mac actually comes with python pre-installed, and a decent Terminal App.

To find your Terminal App, open your `Applications` folder, go to `Utilities`,
and then open `Terminal`. You should put this in your dock because we will be
using it a lot.

#### Test Python Works...

With your terminal open, type `python` and hit enter. If you get a python
prompt that looks a little bit like this:

    Python 2.7.5 (default, Sep  6 2013, 09:55:21)
    [GCC 4.8.1 20130725 (prerelease)] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>

Then it works, press `Ctrl + D` to close python, and then again to close the
terminal.

### Windows

Instructions to come... (this will take a while to get right, and requires me
to actually use windows)

If I don't actually get round to doing this in time, follow the in-depth
instructions on Zed Shaw's Free Online Python Course (**Note: Ignore the stuff
about installing Notepad++**):
