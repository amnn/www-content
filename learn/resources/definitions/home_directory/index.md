A **home directory** is the place on the computer's hard drive that is assigned to you, the currently logged-in user, to store your files. Usually the home directory is only accessible to the user it belongs to.

In Linux, this is located at `/home/your_username`, and can be navigated to in the [[terminal]] by using the command `cd ~`, where tilde is a shortcut for your home directory.

In Mac OSX, this is located at `/users/your_username`, and can be navigated to in the [[terminal]] by using the command `cd ~`, where tilde is a shortcut for your home directory.

In Windows, this is located at `C:\Users\your_username`, and can be nagivated to in the [[terminal|command prompt]] by using the command `cd %homepath%`, because Windows is sometimes *special* and doesn't follow conventions.
