A **comment** is part of a program's **source code** that is there solely to explain what the code is doing to people reading the code. It is completely ignored by the [[interpreter]], but despite this is essential to make sure that when you write code, you (or other people!) can understand what it does six months from now when it's no longer fresh in your mind.

Badly commented, or under-commented code is the bane of professional programmer's lives.
