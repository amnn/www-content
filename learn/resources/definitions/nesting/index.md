**Nesting** is the placement of **control structures** like `if`, `for` and `while` inside other control structures, which allows for the creation of far more complicated programs than would be possible without. Imagine trying to write something that fills in a 10x10 grid without being able to write

    for x in range(10):
	    for y in range(10):
		    grid.fill(x,y)

It would be repetitive, unreadable and hideous. Nesting solves this problem.
