In Python, a **package** (or **module**) is a library of code that provides some functionality to other programs that wish to use it. For example, in [[/learn/resources/lesson_1|Lesson 1]] we use a package called **`turtle`** that allows us to move around a turtle on the screen, but Python comes with plenty more of these.

A few examples include **`urllib2`** - a package for treating web addresses like regular files, **`calendar`** - a package for manipulating dates and their textual representations, and **`random`** - a package for generating random numbers.
