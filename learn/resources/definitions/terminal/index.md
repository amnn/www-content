A **terminal** (or **console**, **command-line** or **command prompt** if you go by Microsoft slang) is a way of interacting with a computer solely through lines of text. It was ubiquitous in the earlier days of computing before graphical operating systems were the norm, but it still plays a crucial role in the more advanced side of computer usage today, such as for system administration and software development.
