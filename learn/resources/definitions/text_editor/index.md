A **text editor** is a program used for viewing and manipulating plain text, such as program **source code**. There are many text editors with many features desirable to programmers such as **syntax highlighting** - colouring different types of source code differently like variables, numbers and keywords and automatic indentation of lines which is a must for a language like Python that depends on having correct indentation to function.
