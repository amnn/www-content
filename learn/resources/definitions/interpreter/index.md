An **interpreter** is a program that takes a textual representation of another program (its **source code**) and runs it without needing an explicit step to convert it from its human-readable form to something that can be directly executed by a computer (**compilation**).

The advantages of an interpreter are numerous, but the one we're most interested in is that it's a lot faster to get started - nobody who's learning programming for the first time wants to sit around waiting for their code to compile before they get to see results! Instead, you get instant results with no middle step.
