membership of Compsoc.

university for free (non-members are charged depending on the event) as well to
vote at general meetings and be elected to the committee. It also makes you
eligible to win prizes in the Technology Comptetition. Ordinary members will
also receive a CompSoc membership card.

Membership forms are available by pigeon post from the Secretary , or you can
download and print an electronic version .

* Note: Anyone may attend talks run by CompSoc for free

Please hand your completed membership and payment form to a committee member at
any meeting, or send it to the Secretary by pigeon post to “Sam Lanning, St.
Catherine's College”.
