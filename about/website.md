[meta title="This Website" header="About The CompSoc Website" /]

We have very recently completely updated the CompSoc website and put it on a
brand new server. It is not complete yet, there is much more work still to be
done!

The website is powered by Python, a combination of
[Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/), [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/), and a
library written by Sam Lanning (President 2013-2014) called wikilite. *(He
intends to release it open-source once it is &quot;complete&quot; enough)*.

The source content (markdown) for the website is publically available on
**GitHub** at this url:
[github.com/oxcompsoc/www-content](https://github.com/oxcompsoc/www-content)

Most of the old website pages are still available under the url
[[/legacy|/legacy]], and any of the old URLS will redirect to here.

The old website was powered by ikiwiki, you can find out more information about
it here: [[/legacy/meta/]]
