The Oxford University Computer Society (CompSoc) exists to promote the use of
IT, computers and the internet and to organise meetings for members to further
our computing interests.  Meetings often include talks by invited guest speakers
as well as practical courses run by Compsoc members on fields in which they are
particularly interested.  We also hold a variety of social events including Film
Nights, Gaming (LAN) Parties, and weekly "Geek Nights". For more information on
our activities, you can take a look at our [[/events]].

The society was founded at St John's College in 1978.  To find out more, have a
read of our fairly comprehensive [[history|history]].  You might also want to read our
[[constitution]].  We have general meetings at least once a term, as per the
constitution; our [[/minutes]] are available if you're within `.ox.ac.uk`.

If you are interested in receiving details of our events by e-mail but are not a
member, you can [subscribe to the compsoc-announce mailing list][announce], or
of course [[/join]]!  (If you are a Compsoc member you should
already be on our members' mailing list which will receive much the same
information.)

Please address general comments or questions on Compsoc to the [[/committee]]
(<committee@ox.compsoc.net>); matters related to the administration of the
network should be sent to our [[network/System_Administrators]]
(<sysadmin@ox.compsoc.net>).

## Our GitHub

We have a [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/oxcompsoc) where we upload the
content of our website. You can find out how our website works here:

We plan on hopefully increasing the number of public respositories on our
GitHub profile over time, so keep watch!
