At [G-Research](http://www.gresearch.co.uk/) we research algorithmic trading
strategies to predict price movements in financial markets across multiple
asset classes.  We hire the best Quantitative Analysts, Software Developers and
IT Analysts to produce quantitative investment research, software and IT
systems for use in investment management.

Our Software Developers create bespoke software to give research and trade
execution platforms the edge.  Developers work in project-driven and dynamic
teams using their technical skills and experience to produce robust and
scalable software that is at the heart of everything we do.  They grasp
core programming concepts such as algorithms and data structures, and
appreciate good software architecture.

Our IT Analysts upgrade, maintain and support globally distributed IT systems
used to trade 24/7. At G-Research the scale of our physical and virtual IT
Infrastructure dwarfs those of other companies many times the size, with
continuing investment in the latest IT technologies to keep ahead of the
competition.

Our Quantitative Analysts apply scientific methods from areas such as machine
learning, Bayesian statistics or physics to help them find patterns in
real-world financial data sets.  Techniques such as time series analysis,
probability theory and regression analysis are used to predict the future.
Our Quantitative Analysts work on their own ideas and pursue the problem
that especially interest them to research novel strategies for use in global
markets.

The working environment is positive and informal; there is no dress code, and
people are judged on the quality of their work.  G-Research can offer you a
rewarding career in a dynamic firm where good ideas are encouraged, recognised
and rewarded from all employees.
