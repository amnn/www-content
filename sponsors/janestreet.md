[Jane Street](http://www.janestreet.com/) is a quantitative trading
firm with a unique focus on technology and collaborative problem solving. Our
trading is based on our own proprietary models and on busy days we engage in
over a million trades. Technology is at the core of how we approach trading,
and we consider ourselves as much a technology company as a trading firm. We
use OCaml (a statically typed functional programming language) as our primary
development language.

Our growth comes from hiring and training amazing people and giving them the
tools they need to innovate. Our culture is casual and our careers are
intensely rewarding.
