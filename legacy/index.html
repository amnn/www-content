things of a computer-related nature.

   Recently the CompSoc AGM elected a new committee who will begin running the society from Trinity term.

   They are all 1st year Computer Scientists at St Catherine's College, and have formed the committee as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    President - Pete York
   </li>
   <li>
    Vice-President - Mike Savage
   </li>
   <li>
    Secretary - Sam Lanning
   </li>
   <li>
    Treasurer - Laura Bengescu
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   A more comprehensive introduction from them will probably follow on the mailing list at some point.
