  Officers' reports
 </h2>
 <h3>
  President's report
 </h3>
 <p>
  Not much to report, about 6 new members this term, income from a new sponsorship and events were popular (especially the Google one – almost alarmingly so).
 </p>
 <h3>
  Secretary's report
 </h3>
 <p>
  Re-registration was accepted, and we'll know early next week if we can use Oxford University in our name.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Treasurer's report
 </h3>
 <p>
  We've got money from a new sponsorship, the accounts are looking good, and the Nationwide account has been closed.
 </p>
 <h2>
  Motions
 </h2>
 <h3>
  Closure of Barclays account
 </h3>
 <p>
  Close the £2.76 Barclays account for completion because it was a lot of trouble to get it in Ben's name, and it's only in his at the moment. Passes unopposed.
 </p>
 <p>
  No other issues.
 </p>
