  Discussion
 </h3>
 <p>
  Tom Ford opened the debate. He explained that this emergency meeting was called as a direct result of the recent AGM. At this meeting, Ian Lynagh was elected treasurer, on the understanding that Ganesh Sittampalam would join the committee as acting treasurer until Ian had finished his exams. However, a careful reading of the constitution later raised doubts as to Ganesh's eligibility for a committee position. This emergency meeting was called to amend the constitution so that Ganesh's position was clear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tom acknowledged that this meeting had been called at rather short notice, and that amending the constitution in this way is an unprecedented step. However, he said the amendments were within the spirit of both the constitution and the wishes of the AGM.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was generally agreed that, in making changes such as this to the constitution, we must be careful to preserve the emphasis of Compsoc as a student society.
