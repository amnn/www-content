 <h2>
  Treasurer's Report, Pete
 </h2>
 <p>
  “clearly using our money as much as we can.”
 </p>
 <h2>
  President Report
 </h2>
 <p>
  Terms gone well, Google and BoAML events really popular, term went well, and we've got lots to look
forward to next term. It would be cool if we managed to do more academic talks next term. And as
Alasdair said we need to find a way to spend our money more effectively. Unity mentioned, probably
be able to get free licenses.
 </p>
 <p>
  VPS: Alasdair: Sam needs to get FAQ out so members can request new VPSes. Mike: maybe look into
Github Pro, Alasdair: why not roll your own on a VPS, Mike: not the same, not as social.
 </p>
 <h2>
  Secretary's Report

 <p>
  Number of new members: 33
 </p>
 <p>
  Membership cards were issued, and well received.
 </p>
 <h2>
  Further Discussion
 </h2>
 <p>
  Brought up CUCaTS: Alasdiar: we should invite a speaker they had who did a talk on VPS security.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pete: Palantir are willing to pay for a joint Paint-Balling event at some in-between paint-balling
location, and Palantir have said they will pay for the travel and book out the venue. We have suggested
first Saturday of Hilary term, CUCaTS are contacting them re: booking. We probably wont have issues
with over interest as we will be booking out the whole venue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Try and pick another weekend where we can do a joint event in Bletchley Park with CUCaTS, bring it
up as soon as they get back re: paint-balling. Choices for travel: train / bus / hire coach / minibus but
we need a driver in addition to hiring the minibus, Dom might be qualified, for a university minibus
hire we need a driver who has done the correct course.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meeting paused to order pizza: 19:26
 </p>
 <p>
  Meeting resumed 19:35
 </p>
 <p>
  Sam: Coding / Project Night:
 </p>
 <p>
  The idea is that for an evening each week we host a coding social where people can come along
have pizza and code into the night. Projects etc. Could be hosted each weekend throughout term in
addition to all the existing events.
 </p>
 <p>
  Peter N: Possibly something like a Codeathon, one big coding event competition: Sam: possible in
competition with CUCaTS, Alasdair: Maybe even further a-field like Warwick and Durham. Large event.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pete Y: Unity, maybe try and gain a license for member use if there is interest, and negotiate maybe for
free. Alasdair: potentially organise a talk and then discuss licensed afterwards. Peter N: maybe XNA
from Microsoft? Pete Y: Either would be good.
 </p>
 <p>
  Matthew B: Stash / hoodies / tees etc... possibly OUStash, Sam: maybe something like StuStash would
work better, StuPrint have previously been a very good company to use for printed stuff. Potentially
good to buy if an inter-society event occurs so we can justify the cost of printing hoodies and tees etc.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sam: Plan of Action for continued Committee, encourage people in lower years to be on the committee.
Matthew: need to entice new members and those who are maybe not as exposed or knowledgeable
about computers; introductory events etc...
 </p>
 <p>
  Alasdair: We need more of a broad range of of topics and talks, less industry / sponsorships ans varied
stuff like real-world tech projects / academic talks / member talks / lightning talks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meeting paused: 20:00
 </p>
 <p>
  Meeting resumed 20:17
Pete Y: Contact suggested more software engineering talks, not advanced on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Peter N: In a hackathon, maybe set opposing teams hacking challenges! Puzzles to solve on a VPS etc,
maybe something that could be set up during the coding nights. Maybe something we could do between
members of the society where we set each other challenges and try and hack in the coding nights.
 </p>
 <p>
  Peter N: Steam group for CompSoc to make gaming nights better...
 </p>
 <p>
  Alasdair: VPSes: Get everything out as soon as possible and get an infrastructure so we have a better
negotiating position with elastic hosts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Matthew: Maybe try talks with other societies, with subjects that overlap the relevant courses! And that
will interest both societies. E.G Computational Biology...
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe a crew date with another society too...
 </p>
 <p>
  For events like crew date, we would advertise them only to existing members and not use a cocktails
night / crew date as a way to entice new members who otherwise wouldn't be interested in the society.
 </p>
 <p>
  All attending committee members give new committee position of Liaison Officer to Matthew B.
 </p>
 <p>
  Matthew B may try to organise events with other societies or other events in general.
 </p>
 <p>
  Peter N and Matthew B: Ideas for gathering new ideas to improve the society from members. Maybe
some kind of rewards system. Possibly of monetary value, Pete Y &amp; Mike: Don't think it's a great idea.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sam: Maybe something like badges on their accounts on the website.
 </p>
 <p>
  Topic changed to public relations, engage with members, find out why they come, if there are new
faces introduce yourself and talk and entice etc...
 </p>
 <p>
  Pete Y: Maybe send out emails via department more often, well received.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kristian: For coding projects, maybe doing something freelance based. Sam, Pete, Alasdair: Would be
better if this was not officially organised or backed by the society, as commercial projects like this are
not really appropriate for it. But doing freelance projects in the coding night by their own accord should
be fine.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next term, organising events to finish early enough before geek night so members can proceed to that
afterwards: Manol: possibly make the event “attending geek night”.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meeting finished at 21:10
 </p>
 <p>
  For notes: pizza left, a meltdown almost untouched
