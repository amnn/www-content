 <h2>
  Apologies for absence
 </h2>
 <p>
  Huw Pryce sent apologies.
 </p>
 <p>
  We had hoped that more comlab people would come today, but noted that they will have exams now and
that perhaps we should have held the meeting earlier in the term.
 </p>
 <h2>
  Discussion of MT 2011
 </h2>
 <p>
  There was a lot of discussion about the termcard, and it was suggested that we:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Do one event per week -- not as much as previous term card to begin with
  </li>
  <li>
   Do socials at the end of terms
  </li>
  <li>
   Consider academics to give talks, but want to avoid 'boring' talks. Suggesting Dr
Ker(steganography) and Mike Spivey(programming) -- would expect their talks to be good.
  </li>
  <li>
   Invite Netcraft to give a talk on phishing and also to do a hands on event where they set up a
website on a server with vulnerabilities, and give people points for finding the
vulnerabilities. There were worries about accessibility, and suggestions that we organise it
for the end of a term.
  </li>
  <li>
   Invite Richard Clayton of Cambridge, who is a researcher in the security department there.
He has given a talk on phishing, in which the theme was how phishers actually make their
money without leaving a trace, with examples of sites which were live at the time of the
talk, demonstrating what fake sites look like. He worked on ATM and chip and PIN
technologies.
  </li>
  <li>
   Run a social video night.
  </li>
  <li>
   May invite libertarian society to talk about bitcoins.
  </li>
  <li>
   Might want to do another to Bletchley Park, which was strongly recommended by those who
have been before.
  </li>
  <li>
   Might do something like another past event, which was a trip to the Science Museum which
had an exhibit on the history of computer games.
  </li>
  <li>
   Invite those who run the 5 year research program in the University of Surrey, which has a
grant from EU to work on electronic election systems -- they do a demo with their systems
allowing people to vote on them to display how it works. They aim to provide a
cryptographically secure 'perfect' electronic voting system.
  </li>
  <li>
   Have an attractive event in 3rd week to encourage freshers to join by then to take advantage
of the lower membership fees.
  </li>
  <li>
   Might want to get involved in competitions, particularly from BCS.
  </li>
  <li>
   Invite Torchbox to an event, who sponsor Oxford Geek Night and have ties to CompSoc
through ex members having internships/employment there.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2>
  Handover
 </h2>
 <p>
  It was noted that with regards to the handover, the only remaining thing is to hand over the
accounts. Formal thanks followed from the new committee to the existing members who helped
with the handover.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Freshers' fair
 </h3>
 <p>
  We talked about freshers' fair, but the information has not been released by OUSU yet. It was noted
that it is the most effective opportunity to get people interested in the society. We decided to plan
logistics closer to the time, when we have a more solid termcard to attract new members. It was said
that the main gain from freshers' fair is the email signups, and that variety in the Michaelmas
termcard is essential to achieve them.
 </p>
 <h2>
  Funding
 </h2>
 <p>
  It was explained that CompSoc gets its funding from corporate sponsors (sometimes in the form of
donated machines), occasionally from adverts on termcards, and also from membership fees.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, fees have been lowered to increase membership -- there's a balance between funding
events like freshers' fair and freshers' drinks and providing lunch/travel expenses for speakers, while
keeping fees low enough to get new members involved.
 </p>
 <h2>
  Network
 </h2>
 <p>
  We talked about the unused machine at Worcester, and noted that we haven't found a new
SysAdmin - Dom agreed to continue maintaining the server. The server started off in someone's
college room, but was noisy and hot so moved to Jesus, Trinity and Worcester, who gave a key and
an authorisation letter for access.
 </p>
 <h2>
  Possible services
 </h2>
 <p>
  We talked about services that CompSoc might want to offer its members:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Shell accounts, but doubts about the benefits of this to members
  </li>
  <li>
   Members often used to join to get the email address.
  </li>
  <li>
   The society once bought 1000-2000 floppy disks in bulk and sold them to the membership.
  </li>
  <li>
   There is a trade-off nowadays between becoming involved in the services provided by the
society and the ease of setting up a virtual machine on personal computers.
  </li>
  <li>
   We might consider setting up a server, but it's not known how much of a draw it would be
for members, balanced against the cost -- especially when amazon, for example, allow
people to easily hire a server.
  </li>
 </ul>
