  3. Officers' Reports
 </h2>
 <h3>
  President's Report
 </h3>
 <p>
  TF said the society had enjoyed a successful year, with many good events. This term has been somewhat quieter, but saw the launch of our redesigned website.
 </p>
 <p>
  He also announced the donation of a new computer for the society network, thanks to Simon Cole and AMD. He was pleased to inform the society that he had already dismantled the machine and found it well built!
 </p>
 <p>
  He finished by thanking the other committee members for the role they have played over the last year.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Secretary's Report
 </h3>
 <p>
  JS said we had gained 17 new members over the course of the last year.
 </p>
 <p>
  He expanded slightly on the topic of the new website, urging members not to use Netscape 4.x because of its horribly broken CSS support and many other bugs.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Treasurer's Report
 </h3>
 <p>
  TFM was pleased to announce that he had managed to produce accounts in time for the meeting. However, they contained a slight mistake as he had lost (and then found) a cheque.
 </p>
 <p>
  Over the course of the year we seem to have made a slight profit, although payments for the black tie dinner have not yet been finalised.
 </p>
 <h3>
  System Administration Co-ordinator's Report
 </h3>
 <p>
  IL said that this had been a disastrous term, thanks to the death of Fishy on 22 January. This caused major disruption, both to the running of the network and to the sleep patterns of some of our valiant sysadmins. By the time of this meeting, however, pretty much everything was running smoothly again.
 </p>
