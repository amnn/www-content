 <h2>
  1. Apologies
 </h2>
 <p>
  Fennel Aurora apologised for being born.
 </p>
 <h2>
  2. Minutes of Last Meeting
 </h2>
 <p>
  §5.1 of the minutes of the previous meeting was noted as being incorrect — Tom Ford, not David Sheldon, was elected unopposed as President.
 </p>
 <p>
  The whole of §6 of the previous minutes was also incorrect. This section should simply read "no motions were received".
 </p>
 <h2>
  3. Matters Arising
 </h2>
 <p>
  David Sheldon said that nothing was happening with respect to the possibility of Vodafone providing us with a server.
 </p>
 <h2>
  4. Officers' Reports
 </h2>
 <h3>
  President's Report
 </h3>
 <p>
  TF said that the term had gone well so far, and that the programming meeting was especially good. MathEngine and Sophos had both provided good talks. He said we were in need of more members, so a membership push was planned for next term. This would include a poster campaign. He also announced plans to produce more t-shirts.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Secretary's Report
 </h3>
 <p>
  JS said we had gained one new member this term.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Treasurer's Report
 </h3>
 <p>
  TFM announced that we have more money than last term, having not taken any speakers to eat at Browns. He also pointed out the difficulties of co-ordinating with some speakers when none of the committee have mobile phones.
 </p>
 <h3>
  System Administration Co-ordinator's Report
 </h3>
 <p>
  IL said that Mailman has been installed on the Compsoc machines by Dominic Hargreaves and is being used to run the oxlug-chat mailing list. He went on to say that Sticky broke, and was replaced by Bitty by Stephen White. Dom and IL have since upgraded Bitty. Various general clear outs had taken place, and Sparky, the machine in Leeds, had been configured as a status monitor to alert the system administrators if anything breaks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stephen White added that Spiffy hasn't crashed recently -- it's been stable since the sysadmins stopped trying to fix it.
 </p>
 <h2>
  Motions
 </h2>
 <p>
  No motions were received.
 </p>

  Any Other Business
 </h2>
 <h3>
  Thanks
 </h3>
 <p>
  TF thanked Dan Kolb for arranging the room for this meeting.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Senior Member
 </h3>
 <p>
  TF informed the meeting that our Senior Member, Dr Clive Rodgers, is soon to retire. He will still be in Oxford and eligible to continue as Senior Member, but he will not necessarily be available whenever we need him. Therefore, it seems sensible to consider other possibilities for the post of Senior Member.
 </p>
 <p>
  Various suggestions for this post were made, including Mr Bernard Sufrin (Comlab), Dr Mike Spivey (Comlab) and Dr Gavin Dalton (Astrophysics). Perhaps the most popular suggestion was Dr John Singleton, Physics tutor at Corpus and former Microsoc member. It was agreed that it was best to avoid OUCS staff to avoid any possible conflict of interest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alasdair Kergon suggested that the Senior Member could be appointed on a yearly basis in future.

 <p>
  TF mentioned the
  <a href="mailto:compsoc@ox.compsoc.net">
   compsoc@ox.compsoc.net

  mailing list, explaining that it was a discussion list for anybody interested in the running of the society. Those interested in joining should e-mail

 <h3>
  Library
 </h3>
 <p>
  David Sheldon has written some Perl to manage the library (which, TFM pointed out, was disbanded in 1997). It works everywhere except on Sticky, for no obvious reason.
