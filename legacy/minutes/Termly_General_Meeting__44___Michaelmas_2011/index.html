  Treasurer's report
 </h3>
 <p>
  Laurens reports a rise in finances over the term, attributed to sponsorship from Deloitte, Gloucester Research, Metaswitch, Jane Street Capital and Netcraft. A sponsorship deal has been agreed with BoAML potentially for 3 years starting next year. We received more offers, but have been hesitant to accept them so that we can focus on what we have, and to not have too much money. BoAML and Netcraft events were the most popular in this term.
We have enough money to not need to charge fees, but will continue to do so for caution, and also to let people feel they are invested in the society. We're looking to get membership cards printed next term.
Ben proposes approving the accounts, seconded by Ian. Unanimously passes.

  President's report

 <p>
  CompSoc has done well this term, with the biggest yearly growth the society has ever seen. This is attributed to having more money, so we can afford to have smaller fees and more pizza. Although this term has gone well we need to look forward and prepare for next term, and start thinking about the next committee so that the society doesn't run out of steam. We plan to start advertising for the new committee in an email at the beginning of next term.

  We hope to become Oxford University Computer Society next term, as we will have been registered for the required two terms by then.

  Ideas for Hilary 2012 events
 </h2>
 <p>
  Events next term include talks by Jane Street Capital, Google and Gloucester Research. Cambridge CompSoc want an exchange-type trip. Discussion included that: Such events used to be annual, alternately there and here, and included things like scavenger hunts; there is a computing history museum just outside Cambridge ('Centre for Computer History'); Bletchley Park was popular in the past and it's halfway between Oxford and Cambridge so it could work for the joint trip; Bletchley Park seems pricey on their website at Â£15pp, but we could get a group &amp; student discount, or pay separately for the museum and Bletchley Park; Cambridge might already be planning a scavenger hunt, so Ben will e-mail them about a Bletchley Park trip to see if it could work.
Other ideas for Hilary Term include talks by Robert Cook or David Deutsch or someone from quantum computing. Also maybe EA games, but we don't have a contact there. There's also a local games company, and BoAML suggest a talk on python which might be left until Trinity because they want to do it towards the end of a term. Also suggested was another games night, which attracted a few new members. Netcraft want to do the event they cancelled this term next term, but we plan to suggest they do it next year. Linux talks as an aside from the rest of the programme were also suggested, pointing out that they could teach SysAdmin skills.
Lightning talks focussed on programming-problem-solving are suggested, and standalone challenges (like ICFP) are discussed.
