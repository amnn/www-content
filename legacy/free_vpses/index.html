  What's the deal?
 </h2>
 <p>
  <a href="http://www.elastichosts.com/">
   ElasticHosts
  </a>
  is generously offering any Compsoc member who can make good use of it a free Virtual Machine (VM) for the duration of their studies at the University. Please not this is only available to
  <strong>
   current
  </strong>
  students of the University of Oxford.
 </p>
 <h2>
  How large are the VMs?
 </h2>
 <p>
  This will vary according to how many members take up the offer. Initial machines have 1GB of RAM and you can request up to 50GB of disk space.
 </p>
 <h2>
  Are there any restrictions?
 </h2>
 <p>
  VMs are intended for the personal use of members.  They must not be sold on to others.  Advertising (within the terms of service) is permitted and so is limited commercial use e.g. offering your skills through a personal consultancy or using the VM for a start-up company in which you are actively involved.  If in doubt, ask sysadmin@ox.compsoc.net for advice.  You must of course still comply with University and JANET regulations where applicable.

  How do I request a VM?
 </h2>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <p>
    If you don't already have a Compsoc forwarding email address, send a message to
    <a href="mailto:sysadmin@ox.compsoc.net">
     sysadmin@ox.compsoc.net
    </a>
    to request one.  These are of the form firstname.surname@ox.compsoc.net or nickname@ox.compsoc.net, so state your preferred name and state the address to which email should be forwarded.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Sign up for a free trial VM using your @ox.compsoc.net email address at
    <a href="http://www.elastichosts.com/cloud-hosting/free-trial">
     http://www.elastichosts.com/cloud-hosting/free-trial
    </a>
    . For "Desired location" you must choose "US: San Antonio (Peer 1)".
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    At or near the end of the trial period, email support@elastichosts.com to confirm that you wish to continue using the VM.  The length of the trial will be extended, typically for a further 3 months.  You'll need to renew your VM like this again after 3 months.  If you build up a clear pattern of long-term usage, then they might agree to longer intervals between renewals.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>
 <h2>
  What operating systems can I use?
 </h2>
 <p>
  Several linux/BSD disk images are available to get you started, or you can upload your own.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you want to use Windows you must either pay to use a Windows image from ElasticHosts at its standard rate or else obtain your own licence and install it independently.
 </p>
 <h2>
  Can I use my own domain name?
 </h2>
 <p>
  Yes.  First request a fixed IP from
  <a href="mailto:support@elastichosts.com">
   support@elastichosts.com
  </a>
  and then register your domain name with any external domain registrar to point to your fixed IP address.
 </p>
 <h2>
  I've discovered some ports are blocked.  Can they be opened up?
 </h2>
 <p>
  Yes. Ask
  <a href="mailto:support@elastichosts.com">
   support@elastichosts.com
  </a>
  .  If you want port 25 opening you will need to agree to some straightforward restrictions concerning mailing lists.
 </p>
 <h2>
  Can I have more RAM or disk space?
 </h2>
 <p>
  Special requests for additional resources (beyond 1GB RAM + 50GB disk) must be made through
  <a href="mailto:sysadmin@ox.compsoc.net">
   sysadmin@ox.compsoc.net
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <h2>
  Can I use space on a SSD?
 </h2>
 <p>
  Only if you pay ElasticHosts for this directly at their standard rates. Also note they may need to migrate your VPS to a different zone as sat-p does not currently have SSD support. This is entirely up to the discretion of Elastic Hosts.
 </p>
 <h2>
  Can I use IPv6?
 </h2>
 <p>
  Yes. Ask
  <a href="mailto:support@elastichosts.com">
   support@elastichosts.com
  </a>
  for this.  It is currently a trial service. And again this service is not supported in sat-p so will require a migration, and be up to Elastic Hosts to make that decision.
 </p>
 <h2>
  Is my data backed up?
 </h2>
 <p>
  No.  You are responsible for backing up your own virtual machine and data.
 </p>
 <h2>
  I'm running a website on my VM.  Do I need to tell people that this is hosted with ElasticHosts?
 </h2>
 <p>
  Yes.  Services running on VMs (e.g. websites) should acknowledge that they are hosted at ElasticHosts.  Be careful not to imply endorsement.
 </p>
 <p>
  A simple "Hosted at &lt;a href="http://www.elastichosts.com/"&gt;ElasticHosts&lt;/a&gt;." at the bottom of the main pages would be sufficient.
 </p>
