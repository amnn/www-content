  You can't listen to music on an Operating System
 </h2>
 <p>
  An OS doesn't upload data to your MP3 player, iTunes does. An OS does not enable you bid for things you don't want or need on EBAY when you are drunk, a gaggle of software components from your web browser to the EBAY database do that.  Operating systems just manage resources such as cpu, memory, network, disk, displays and your attention on behalf of applications which make requests for resources through the OS.
 </p>
 <p>
  When things do go wrong, data gets corrupted, performance is poor or programs die, the OS as master of resource scheduling is often the best place to start debugging errant behavior of the wider system.
 </p>
 <p>
  This talk assumes zero previous knowledge of Solaris, but hold on to your hats, some of it might get quite technical.
 </p>
 <p>
  The speaker hopes you will leave this talk with an understanding of the what, why and how for some of the ground breaking technologies in Solaris such as DTrace, ZFS and Zones.
