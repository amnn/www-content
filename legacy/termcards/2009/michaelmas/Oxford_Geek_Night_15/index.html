  The Oxford Geek Night isn't a Compsoc event, but is still worth attending (and quite a few of us do so); the event consists of two 15 minute 'keynote' talks, followed by several microslots (normally around 5 minutes each).
 </p>
 <p>
  The first keynote speaker is Jeni Tennison, an expert on the semantic web whose talk is titled
  <em>
   Linked data on data.gov.uk
  </em>
  . Three of the microsolt speakers have been confirmed, but there's still one spot open. If you're feeling particularly daring, you can attend without trying to find out beforehand what all the talks will be about. If you're feeling entirely reckless, you can

   volunteer for a microslot yourself
  </a>
  .
 </p>

  The event runs at a reasonably relaxed pace, and there's plenty of chance to get a drink from the upstairs bar (note that the whole event is upstairs - don't get confused by the JT looking perfectly normal downstairs that day).
