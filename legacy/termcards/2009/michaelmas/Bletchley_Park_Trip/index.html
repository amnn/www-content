  Bletchley Park, Milton Keynes

 <p>
  The importance of
  <a href="http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/">
   Bletchley Park
  </a>
  in the outcome of the Second World War doesn't need to noted here. On top of the code-breaking history, the site is also a host to the
  <a href="http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/edu/collect/computer.rhtm">
   British Computer Museum
  </a>
  , so the trip has double relevance for Compsoc.
 </p>
 <p>
  We're also hoping to meet up with University College, London's Computer Society while at Bletchley. All in all, this promises to be quite a memorable event.
 </p>
 <p>
  We will be catching the X5 bus to Milton Keynes (at a cost of £10.50 for a return ticket) and then taking a 10 minute train trip (at a cost of £3.10 for a return ticket) to Bletchley. Entry to Bletchley park is £8 if you have a BOD card, £10 otherwise. Once you have bought a ticket you can in fact use the ticket for up to 12 months after it was bought.

 <p>
  We will meet at Gloucester Green bus station on George Street at 9:15am on Saturday, and will probably be back in Oxford by 6 or 7pm (when we leave is generally left up to consensus).

  Bletchley park is an amazing place to visit, and if you think you might want to come please email
