    This coming Thursday (the 15th) the staff at Oxford University Computing 
Services have graciously invited us on a tour of their data centre. The 
tour starts at 17:30, and
    <em>
     YOU MUST BRING YOUR BOD CARD
    </em>
    otherwise the 
receptionist will not let you in. You will get the opportunity to:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     See lots of computers, flashing lights, cables, air conditioning ducts
    </li>
    <li>
     See the amazing robot arm that moves hard disks around and then 
punches you in the face
    </li>
    <li>
     Ask awkward questions about file sharing (don't do this)
    </li>
    <li>
     Complain about nexus email (don't do this either)
    </li>
    <li>
     Ask genuinely interesting questions about sysadmin/operating 
systems/bandwidth
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Afterwards, we will go to the pub, where you can talk to people who 
won't glaze over if you start talking about something vaguely technical. 
The person to ask the best question(s) on the tour gets a free drink at 
the pub afterwards!
   </p>
   <p>
    Hope to see you there,
   </p>

    Bletchley Park, Milton Keynes

    The importance of
    <a href="http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/">
     Bletchley Park
    </a>
    in the outcome of the Second World War doesn't need to noted here. On top of the code-breaking history, the site is also a host to the
    <a href="http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/edu/collect/computer.rhtm">
     British Computer Museum
    </a>
    , so the trip has double relevance for Compsoc.
   </p>
   <p>
    We're also hoping to meet up with University College, London's Computer Society while at Bletchley. All in all, this promises to be quite a memorable event.
   </p>
   <p>
    We will be catching the X5 bus to Milton Keynes (at a cost of £10.50 for a return ticket) and then taking a 10 minute train trip (at a cost of £3.10 for a return ticket) to Bletchley. Entry to Bletchley park is £8 if you have a BOD card, £10 otherwise. Once you have bought a ticket you can in fact use the ticket for up to 12 months after it was bought.
   </p>
   <p>
    We will meet at Gloucester Green bus station on George Street at 9:15am on Saturday, and will probably be back in Oxford by 6 or 7pm (when we leave is generally left up to consensus).
   </p>
   <p>
    Bletchley park is an amazing place to visit, and if you think you might want to come please email

     Jon
    </a>
    so that we have a rough idea of numbers :)

    The Oxford Geek Night isn't a Compsoc event, but is still worth attending (and quite a few of us do so); the event consists of two 15 minute 'keynote' talks, followed by several microslots (normally around 5 minutes each).
   </p>
   <p>
    The first keynote speaker is Jeni Tennison, an expert on the semantic web whose talk is titled
    <em>
     Linked data on data.gov.uk
    </em>
    . Three of the microsolt speakers have been confirmed, but there's still one spot open. If you're feeling particularly daring, you can attend without trying to find out beforehand what all the talks will be about. If you're feeling entirely reckless, you can
    <a href="http://natbat.wufoo.com/forms/oxford-geek-night-microslot-proposal/">
     volunteer for a microslot yourself
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    The event runs at a reasonably relaxed pace, and there's plenty of chance to get a drink from the upstairs bar (note that the whole event is upstairs - don't get confused by the JT looking perfectly normal downstairs that day).

    The Doctor Who Society has invited us to the event below.
   </p>
   <p>
    A bit of an Oxford institution, this one; the geek societies of Oxford all getting together to fight for the title of the brainiest of geekdoms. Individuals are invited to bring a short round of questions about anything they like, although rounds should not focus too heavily on a particular team's specialty. Unusual formats (eg picture / audio) are particularly encouraged.
   </p>
   <p>
    I don't think that Compsoc has attended before, so we could attempt to really make a mark.
