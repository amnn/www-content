  The Doctor Who Society has invited us to the event below.

  Cost: Free to members of DocSoc, Â£2 to non-members
 </p>
 <p>
  Rob Shearman, award-winning author of Doctor Who episode "Dalek", will
be visiting to talk, in Q&amp;A format, about writing sci-fi for the BBC
and anything else that might interest us. Often described as the
"licensed dissenter" of the Russell T Davies era, he is sure to give
us some interesting insights.
