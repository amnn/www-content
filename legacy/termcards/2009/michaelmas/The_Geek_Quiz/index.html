  The Doctor Who Society has invited us to the event below.

 <p>
  A bit of an Oxford institution, this one; the geek societies of Oxford all getting together to fight for the title of the brainiest of geekdoms. Individuals are invited to bring a short round of questions about anything they like, although rounds should not focus too heavily on a particular team's specialty. Unusual formats (eg picture / audio) are particularly encouraged.

  I don't think that Compsoc has attended before, so we could attempt to really make a mark.
