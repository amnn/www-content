    There will be someone on the look-out for people in case you can't find us, although we're usually quite easy to spot...

    Somewhat of a CompSoc tradition, we'll be having a tour of OUCS' machine room, with several mostly-willing OUCS people on hand to show you around, answer questions, and suchlike.
   </p>
   <p>
    It's normally a great insight into the bowels of this most important of departments, and offers many great challenges (such as figuring out quite what their naming scheme is).
   </p>
   <p>
    Meet at the main OUCS entrance on Banbury Road for 17:30; there will be a sign up so you know you're at the right place.

demonstrate how to do useful IM-related things with surprisingly few lines of
Python.

    Bletchley Park
   </p>
   <p>
    We plan to go and visit Bletchley Park, 
one of the homes of modern cryptography, and home of the World War I 
codebreaking effort.
   </p>
   <p>
    We'll be travelling to Bletchley using the bus and train; the X5
from Gloucester Green bus station to Milton Keynes, and then taking the
train from there to Bletchley.
   </p>
   <p>
    Travel costs should be less than £14 (the X5 prices are somewhat cryptic).
Admission to Bletchley itself is £8*, and if you plan to eat at the cafe there you'll
need more money (expect standard visitor-attraction-cafe prices).
   </p>
   <p>
    *(You can get £7 tickets via the
    <a href="http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/shop/index.rhtm/130872/cat.html">
     website and a credit card
    </a>
    )
   </p>
   <p>
    We're meeting at 9:55 at the X5 stop in Gloucester Green bus station (bay 11), getting to Bletchley
around 11:30, and returning sometime in the afternoon.

    In the finest CompSoc tradition, we'll be showing one or more 'traditional' geeky films - suggestions (or, indeed, DVDs of films) are more than welcome. Even better, if enough people have joined this year to refill the coffers, we'll invest in some popcorn and other filmish snacks.

such a computationally-heavy web application, as well as giving a few general tips and pointers
on this sort of web development.

    Meet outside/just inside the Keble Porter's Lodge at 8, and a Very Nice Compsoc Person
will walk you down to the right place.

    Morley Fletcher Room, Worcester
   </p>
   <p>
    One room, one projector, and many speakers. Everyone is invited to give a short talk on something they're involved in or interested in; don't worry if you don't like public speaking, you're more than welcome to watch the rest of us screw it up (although, of course, this would be a great place to give a talk if you've never done so before).
   </p>
   <p>
    Talks don't have to be computer-related, or even technical; if it's interesting, entertaining or pretty, then give it a go! If you 
don't feel like giving a talk, don't worry; come along anyway, there's looking to be a wonderfully varied range of talks.
   </p>
   <p>
    We'll have a projector and a laptop there to show presentations on, but if you're using a particularly obscure file format or prefer your own computer, bring it along.
   </p>
   <p>
    There will be someone at the Worcester porter's lodge to take you along to the room!

    The Termly General Meeting, the pinnacle of democracy. We'll go over the term, make sure everything is in order, check our Treasurer 
hasn't fled to a foreign country with CompSoc's fortune, and hopefully get it over with in a reasonably short amount of time.
   </p>
   <p>
    After that's over, we'll be having a small Christmas party, with some free food and whatever else we can think of - suggestions, games, or whatever are more than welcome!
   </p>
   <p>
    There will be someone at the Magdalen porter's lodge to guide you over to the room.
