 <p>
  Somewhat of a CompSoc tradition, we'll be having a tour of OUCS' machine room, with several mostly-willing OUCS people on hand to show you around, answer questions, and suchlike.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's normally a great insight into the bowels of this most important of departments, and offers many great challenges (such as figuring out quite what their naming scheme is).

 <p>
  Meet at the main OUCS entrance on Banbury Road for 17:30; there will be a sign up so you know you're at the right place.
