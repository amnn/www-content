  Bletchley Park
 </p>
 <p>
  We plan to go and visit Bletchley Park, 
one of the homes of modern cryptography, and home of the World War I 
codebreaking effort.
 </p>
 <p>
  We'll be travelling to Bletchley using the bus and train; the X5
from Gloucester Green bus station to Milton Keynes, and then taking the
train from there to Bletchley.
 </p>
 <p>
  Travel costs should be less than £14 (the X5 prices are somewhat cryptic).
Admission to Bletchley itself is £8*, and if you plan to eat at the cafe there you'll
need more money (expect standard visitor-attraction-cafe prices).
 </p>
 <p>
  *(You can get £7 tickets via the
  <a href="http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/shop/index.rhtm/130872/cat.html">
   website and a credit card
  </a>
  )
 </p>
 <p>
  We're meeting at 9:55 at the X5 stop in Gloucester Green bus station (bay 11), getting to Bletchley
around 11:30, and returning sometime in the afternoon.
