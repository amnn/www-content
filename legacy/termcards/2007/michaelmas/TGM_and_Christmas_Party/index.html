  Oscar Wilde Room, Magdalen
 </p>
 <p>
  The Termly General Meeting, the pinnacle of democracy. We'll go over the term, make sure everything is in order, check our Treasurer 
hasn't fled to a foreign country with CompSoc's fortune, and hopefully get it over with in a reasonably short amount of time.
 </p>
 <p>
  After that's over, we'll be having a small Christmas party, with some free food and whatever else we can think of - suggestions, games, or whatever are more than welcome!
 </p>
 <p>
  There will be someone at the Magdalen porter's lodge to guide you over to the room.
