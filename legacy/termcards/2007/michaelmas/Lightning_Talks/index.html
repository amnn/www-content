  Lightning Talks

  Thursday 22nd November, 20:00
  <br/>
  Morley Fletcher Room, Worcester
 </p>
 <p>
  One room, one projector, and many speakers. Everyone is invited to give a short talk on something they're involved in or interested in; don't worry if you don't like public speaking, you're more than welcome to watch the rest of us screw it up (although, of course, this would be a great place to give a talk if you've never done so before).
 </p>
 <p>
  Talks don't have to be computer-related, or even technical; if it's interesting, entertaining or pretty, then give it a go! If you 
don't feel like giving a talk, don't worry; come along anyway, there's looking to be a wonderfully varied range of talks.
 </p>
 <p>
  We'll have a projector and a laptop there to show presentations on, but if you're using a particularly obscure file format or prefer your own computer, bring it along.
 </p>
 <p>
  There will be someone at the Worcester porter's lodge to take you along to the room!
