    talks on Second Life and IBM, and how virtual worlds are impacting the company and others:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Ian Hughes, a.k.a. 'epredator potato' in Second Life, is an IBM Consulting IT Specialist who has worked on leading edge emerging technologies for the past 17 years, a programmer since he was 14. He is now officially an IBM Metaverse Evangelist having led in bands of colleagues into Second Life for the past year with a view to understanding what the social, business and technical implications are of virtual world technology used with a web 2.0 mentality and user generated content. What makes this work now? What has caused the massive increase in usage from 70,000 to 4.2 million registrations in less than a year? How can business become involved without killing the spirit? Who are we online?
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Head for the Porter's Lodge at Worcester; there will be someone there to guide you to the Sainsbury Common Room.

    In 2003 Ian Hardingham graduated in computer science from Oriel.  He
immediately set up his game development company,
    <a href="http://www.mode7games.com/">
     Mode 7 Games
    </a>
    . With no
investment and very little experience, he and a team of five students set to
work on a stupidly ambitious title — Determinance: a freeform flying
sword-fighting game.  Nearly four years later, Determinance is a success, Mode
7 have a publisher, and they are diversifying into Nintendo DS and Wii games.
   </p>
   <p>
    This Wednesday Ian will come to tell us:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     The best ways to get started in the indie industry.
    </li>
    <li>
     The technology and communities worth getting involved with.
    </li>
    <li>
     How to deal with your artists quitting to become carpenters.
    </li>
    <li>
     The truth about how much money you can make selling games online.
    </li>
    <li>
     How important Mac and Linux actually are to indies.
    </li>
    <li>
     What to do when EA give you an audience - but they think you're crazy.
    </li>
    <li>
     What not to name your games.  (Don't call them anything as stupid as Determinance.)
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    There will be someone at the Keble Porters' Lodge to guide you to the talk.
