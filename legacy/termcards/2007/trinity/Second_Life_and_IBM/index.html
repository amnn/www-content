  talks on Second Life and IBM, and how virtual worlds are impacting the company and others:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Ian Hughes, a.k.a. 'epredator potato' in Second Life, is an IBM Consulting IT Specialist who has worked on leading edge emerging technologies for the past 17 years, a programmer since he was 14. He is now officially an IBM Metaverse Evangelist having led in bands of colleagues into Second Life for the past year with a view to understanding what the social, business and technical implications are of virtual world technology used with a web 2.0 mentality and user generated content. What makes this work now? What has caused the massive increase in usage from 70,000 to 4.2 million registrations in less than a year? How can business become involved without killing the spirit? Who are we online?
