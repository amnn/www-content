  In 2003 Ian Hardingham graduated in computer science from Oriel.  He
immediately set up his game development company,
  <a href="http://www.mode7games.com/">
   Mode 7 Games
  </a>
  . With no
investment and very little experience, he and a team of five students set to
work on a stupidly ambitious title â€” Determinance: a freeform flying
sword-fighting game.  Nearly four years later, Determinance is a success, Mode
7 have a publisher, and they are diversifying into Nintendo DS and Wii games.

  <li>
   The best ways to get started in the indie industry.
  </li>
  <li>
   The technology and communities worth getting involved with.
  </li>
  <li>
   How to deal with your artists quitting to become carpenters.
  </li>
  <li>
   The truth about how much money you can make selling games online.
  </li>
  <li>
   How important Mac and Linux actually are to indies.
  </li>
  <li>
   What to do when EA give you an audience - but they think you're crazy.
  </li>
  <li>
   What not to name your games.  (Don't call them anything as stupid as Determinance.)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  There will be someone at the Keble Porters' Lodge to guide you to the talk.
