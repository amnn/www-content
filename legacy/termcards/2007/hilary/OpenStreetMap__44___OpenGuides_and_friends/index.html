  The last few years has seen an explosion of interest in geographically-aware applications, especially web applications, powered partly by the availability of cheap GPS units. Flickr, a leading photo hosting provider, has integrated geo-tagged photo processing to its site, and Google Earth and Google Maps has popularised the use of high quality mapping and satellite imagery.
 </p>
 <p>
  OpenStreetMap and OpenGuides are two projects that are harnessing this enthusiasm in the "Free" data and code spheres. Together, and with many other projects, they are helping us to describe the world we live in richly, and make this information availble to all in open formats and under open licences.

 <p>
  Dominic will be introducing both projects; giving an overview of their aims and processes; explain how to participate in the projects; and hopefully to show off some cool technologies and uses the data is being used with.
