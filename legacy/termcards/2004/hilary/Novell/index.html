  Matt Asay, Director of Novell's Linux Business Office and Open Source Review Board and responsible for laying the strategic foundation for Novell's use of open source software, is visiting us from Utah.
 </p>
 <p>
  Novell hit the headlines when it bought Ximian (Gnome) and SuSE, and Matt will discuss how Novell now sees itself fitting into the open source community. Having once described himself as a "former Linux naysayer-turned-disciple", he is an acknowledged expert on the GNU General Public License (GPL) and he is willing to answer our questions.

  This event is jointly organised with OxLUG.
