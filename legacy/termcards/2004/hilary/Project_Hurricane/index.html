  Project Hurricane is a new student community portal and SDK designed by 3 MVS students in the UK to enable students to quickly and easily build online portals for student societies or communities of any type. Built on ASP.NET, Project Hurricane includes a whole host of interactive features such as blogging, forums as well as different skins to make it easy to customise your own portal.
