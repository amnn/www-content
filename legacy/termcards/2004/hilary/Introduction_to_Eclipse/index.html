  Doina Klinger and Joe Winchester will give an introduction to Eclipse, an open and extensible Integrated Development Environment that provides world class support for writing Java programs. A demo will show Eclipse in action with the best features such as source control, code assist, debug and refactoring. There will be a bit of background on how Eclipse was created and a presentation of the main concepts and the principles on which Eclipse is based.
