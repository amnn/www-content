    Matt Asay, Director of Novell's Linux Business Office and Open Source Review Board and responsible for laying the strategic foundation for Novell's use of open source software, is visiting us from Utah.
   </p>
   <p>
    Novell hit the headlines when it bought Ximian (Gnome) and SuSE, and Matt will discuss how Novell now sees itself fitting into the open source community. Having once described himself as a "former Linux naysayer-turned-disciple", he is an acknowledged expert on the GNU General Public License (GPL) and he is willing to answer our questions.

    This event is jointly organised with OxLUG.

    Sun Yuan from Compuware is coming to talk to us about the Model Driven Architecture (MDA). The MDA is a new way of writing specifications and developing applications, based on a platform-independent model (PIM). A complete MDA specification consists of a definitive platform-independent base UML model, plus one or more platform-specific models (PSM) and interface definition sets, each describing how the base model is implemented on a different middleware platform. A complete MDA application consists of a definitive PIM, plus one or more PSMs and complete implementations, one on each platform that the application developer decides to support.

    This talk will focus on the practical side of web service development. It will start with a brief introduction to web services as they are now, together with a brief description of the missing pieces and how they are likely to be addressed. It will then go on to consider how the technology can make a useful difference, using the local government environment as an example, with a particular emphasis on how to get the technology off the ground. We'll also try to look at some reasons why turning theory into practice can be a hard thing to do.

    A potential weakness of the public key architecture is that it can be difficult to establish that a given public key actually belongs to whom it claims. In signing a key, you guarantee that you have verified it to be bona fide. The Compsoc key signing party provides just such an opportunity to sign other's keys and thereby build a so-called 'web of trust'.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you plan to come to the meeting, please send your public key to
pgp@ox.compsoc.net not later than Wednesday 3rd March. Please note that it will
be necessary to bring photographic ID and the details of your key with you. See
this page for more details.
