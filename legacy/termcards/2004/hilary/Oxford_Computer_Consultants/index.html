  This talk will focus on the practical side of web service development. It will start with a brief introduction to web services as they are now, together with a brief description of the missing pieces and how they are likely to be addressed. It will then go on to consider how the technology can make a useful difference, using the local government environment as an example, with a particular emphasis on how to get the technology off the ground. We'll also try to look at some reasons why turning theory into practice can be a hard thing to do.
