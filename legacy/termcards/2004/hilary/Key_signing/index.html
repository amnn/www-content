  A potential weakness of the public key architecture is that it can be difficult to establish that a given public key actually belongs to whom it claims. In signing a key, you guarantee that you have verified it to be bona fide. The Compsoc key signing party provides just such an opportunity to sign other's keys and thereby build a so-called 'web of trust'.

  If you plan to come to the meeting, please send your public key to
pgp@ox.compsoc.net not later than Wednesday 3rd March. Please note that it will
be necessary to bring photographic ID and the details of your key with you. See
this page for more details.
