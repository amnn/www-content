  This academic year is the 25th anniversary of our founding (as "St John's College Microcomputer Society"), so we'll be celebrating accordingly! Dress code for the dinner is "smart", i.e a suit of some form (many people will be wearing black tie). The event starts at 7, with food served at 8. Unfortunately it is now too late to sign up for this event.
