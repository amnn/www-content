  Your very own president will be leading a road trip to the Tottenham Court Road in London for all those interested in visiting some of the largest computer fairs in the UK and picking up some bargains.

  Because of a lack of interest this term, this event has been cancelled. It will probably feature as part of Michaelmas 04's forthcoming termcard.
