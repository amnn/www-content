  Ray Miller from OUCS will give us a talk on Herald and related services. The Herald system provides a mail store facility to almost 30,000 users across the University of Oxford, with access via POP, IMAP and the WING web/mail gateway. The service is provided using commodity Intel-based hardware and 100% Free Software. In this talk he will describe the hardware and software components that make up the Herald cluster, with particular emphasis on the areas currently under active development.
