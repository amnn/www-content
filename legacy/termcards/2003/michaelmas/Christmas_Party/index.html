  To reach Goodson Walk go East along South Parks Road past the Science area. When the road turns right take the cycle path to Marston (straight on). At the second cattle grid go straight on past the first road on the right. Turn right, then immediately left after about 20 metres (into Purcell Road), continue straight on, onto a footpath, right at the end of the footpath then left onto Goodson Walk (number 11 is near the end)
