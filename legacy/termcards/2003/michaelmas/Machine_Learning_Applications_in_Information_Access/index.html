  Hugo Zaragoza from Microsoft Research Cambridge will be giving us a talk on an active research topic he is working on.

 <p>
  The field of Information Retrieval deals with the problem of searching and manipulating textual data to answer
  <em>
   user information needs
  </em>
  , such as finding documents on the Internet, classifying email, summarising documents, tracking topics, etc. The application of Machine Learning techniques to Information Retrieval has been very successful in recent years, and is today one of the most promising directions. In my talk I will introduce basic concepts from Information Retrieval and Machine Learning and discuss a number of examples of successful applications, some of which are being incorporated into Microsoft products.
