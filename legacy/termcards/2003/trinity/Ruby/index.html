  No doubt Simon Cozens' talk last term fired you with enthusiasm for Ruby. Now John Swinbank will explore some aspects of the language in a little more detail. The aim isn't so much to be a tutorial as to explore some of the exciting ideas and techniques in the language -- he'll take a look at object orientation, modules, mixins, reflection, ObjectSpace, distributed Ruby, and whatever else seems like fun when he gets round to writing the talk.
