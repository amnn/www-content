  In probably our biggest event this term, Ken Tabb from Apple will be coming to talk to us about Mac OS X, in the context of it being the "new desktop UNIX". Topics covered will include the UNIX-like foundations of OS X, its command-line interface and filesystem, as well as the "Quartz Extreme graphics layer".
