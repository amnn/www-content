  The Oxford Supercomputing Centre (OSC) was established as the result of support from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) Joint Research Equipment Initiative 1997 and Silicon Graphics UK Ltd. The main computer resource installed under this grant, known as Oscar, was deployed in a wide variety of research studies covering biological, medical, chemical, mathematical, physical and engineering topics including parallel computing itself. The talk will cover a wide range of their activities.
