    In probably our biggest event this term, Ken Tabb from Apple will be coming to talk to us about Mac OS X, in the context of it being the "new desktop UNIX". Topics covered will include the UNIX-like foundations of OS X, its command-line interface and filesystem, as well as the "Quartz Extreme graphics layer".

    Following on from the introductory talk last term, Ganesh will cover various more advanced topics, including: a brief overview of regexps, how to make your own modules, references and how to use them to make complicated data structures, higher-order functions and why they're useful, and neat tricks you can do with "tie".

    The Oxford Supercomputing Centre (OSC) was established as the result of support from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) Joint Research Equipment Initiative 1997 and Silicon Graphics UK Ltd. The main computer resource installed under this grant, known as Oscar, was deployed in a wide variety of research studies covering biological, medical, chemical, mathematical, physical and engineering topics including parallel computing itself. The talk will cover a wide range of their activities.

    "Matrix Reloaded" is coming out this week, so one good option for our traditional video night might be to show the original. Other common favourites have been Hackers and Wargames. If you've a particular request, just let us know (we should be DVD and VHS capable).

    The comp.sys.sinclair newsgroup holds irregular, informal meetings at which they reminisce about the good ol' bad ol' days, demonstrate that they never mastered the basic skill that is playing Rainbow Islands, and generally get reasonably ratarsed. Optionally, meet at the train station at 12.20.

    Alasdair Kergon will give a talk on SCM systems including Bitkeeper and CVS. An SCM is a useful tool in the armoury of anybody who works on substantial projects on a computer. It can keep track of old versions of files and keep a log of who made changes, when and why they did so.

    No doubt Simon Cozens' talk last term fired you with enthusiasm for Ruby. Now John Swinbank will explore some aspects of the language in a little more detail. The aim isn't so much to be a tutorial as to explore some of the exciting ideas and techniques in the language -- he'll take a look at object orientation, modules, mixins, reflection, ObjectSpace, distributed Ruby, and whatever else seems like fun when he gets round to writing the talk.
