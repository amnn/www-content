  A version control system is a useful tool in the armoury of anybody who works on substantial projects on a computer. It can keep track of old versions of files (usually, but not necessarily, source code), and keep a log of who made changes, when and why they did so. In the open source — and many other — worlds, this role has been traditionally filled by CVS. Subversion is an up and coming new project which aims to address CVS's deficiencies.
