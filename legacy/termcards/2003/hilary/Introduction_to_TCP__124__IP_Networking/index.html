  TCP/IP is the "glue" that allows completely different networks and computers to be put together to form the Internet. In this talk we will discuss TCP/IP's constituent protocols (IP, ICMP, UDP and TCP) and explain what happens when you connect to a resource on the Internet. There should be plenty of scope go into more detail on any aspect the audience is interested in.
