    TCP/IP is the "glue" that allows completely different networks and computers to be put together to form the Internet. In this talk we will discuss TCP/IP's constituent protocols (IP, ICMP, UDP and TCP) and explain what happens when you connect to a resource on the Internet. There should be plenty of scope go into more detail on any aspect the audience is interested in.

    Many Compsoc members will have applied for an account on the network when they joined, but may be at a bit of a loss as to what to do with it. Building on Alasdair's talk earlier in the term, this will give you a chance to see just what the network is good for and ask questions of its administrators.

    An interpreted scripting language, Perl is sometimes referred to as "Unix's Swiss Army Chainsaw". It's ever more ubiquitous, and, with the ongoing work on Perl 6, it's the subject of active and exciting development. Ganesh Sittampalam will give an introduction to what Perl can do for you.

    Ruby is a completely object-oriented language from Japan. As a scripting language, it is influenced by Perl and Python, but also draws on CLU, Smalltalk and many other less mainstream languages. Simon Cozens, a former Perl devotee and recent Ruby convert, explains how Ruby gives you the best of both worlds.

    A version control system is a useful tool in the armoury of anybody who works on substantial projects on a computer. It can keep track of old versions of files (usually, but not necessarily, source code), and keep a log of who made changes, when and why they did so. In the open source — and many other — worlds, this role has been traditionally filled by CVS. Subversion is an up and coming new project which aims to address CVS's deficiencies.
