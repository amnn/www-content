  Comlab Lecture Theatre A
 </p>
 <p>
  Dr Michael Spivey, Oxford University Department of Computer Science will be presenting this talk. Summary below:
 </p>
 <p>
  A compiler written in its own input language that generates code for a non-existent machine? Surely that's hopelessly impractical! I will talk about my recent experiences in improving GeomLab, a simple functional language, by using a bootstrapped compiler to generate code for the Java Virtual Machine. Good results are surprisingly easy to obtain.

 <p>
  After the talk we will be heading down to the Lamb and Flag for drinks and 'intellectual discussion' with Dr Spivey - anyone is welcome to join us, we may even buy you a drink.

  If you don't know where the department is there are handy directions here: http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/contact/directions.html. Once you have found the department enter the shadowy door behind the bins in http://g.co/maps/p4nqr. Then follow the signs =]
