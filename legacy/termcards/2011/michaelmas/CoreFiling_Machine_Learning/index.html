 <p>
  Using Machine Learning To Solve Real-World Problems
 </p>
 <p>
  How do you approach a classification problem involving thousands of categories rather than the 'usual' five or six? What happens when your data-set is several gigabytes and growing? What open-source tools are available, are they any good, and can they be put to commercial use? How do you measure the system's effectiveness when you're not allowed to see the real data because of client confidentiality?
 </p>
 <p>

   David North
  </a>
  and Richard Ashby, from local software company 
CoreFiling, 
will aim to answer all these questions and more in their talk on machine learning from an industry perspective. There will be free drinks afterwards.

  David has for some time been a CompSoc Systems Administration Co-ordinator

  , if you think you might be interested in taking over this role or just want to know what it is then after the talk would be an excellent opportunity to ask about it.
