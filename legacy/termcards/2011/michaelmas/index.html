    Using Machine Learning To Solve Real-World Problems
   </p>
   <p>
    How do you approach a classification problem involving thousands of categories rather than the 'usual' five or six? What happens when your data-set is several gigabytes and growing? What open-source tools are available, are they any good, and can they be put to commercial use? How do you measure the system's effectiveness when you're not allowed to see the real data because of client confidentiality?
   </p>
   <p>
    <a href="./../../../people/David_North/">
     David North
    </a>
    and Richard Ashby, from local software company 
CoreFiling, 
will aim to answer all these questions and more in their talk on machine learning from an industry perspective. There will be free drinks afterwards.

    Dr Michael Spivey, Oxford University Department of Computer Science will be presenting this talk. Summary below:
   </p>
   <p>
    A compiler written in its own input language that generates code for a non-existent machine? Surely that's hopelessly impractical! I will talk about my recent experiences in improving GeomLab, a simple functional language, by using a bootstrapped compiler to generate code for the Java Virtual Machine. Good results are surprisingly easy to obtain.
   </p>
   <p>
    After the talk we will be heading down to the Lamb and Flag for drinks and 'intellectual discussion' with Dr Spivey - anyone is welcome to join us, we may even buy you a drink.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you don't know where the department is there are handy directions here: http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/contact/directions.html. Once you have found the department enter the shadowy door behind the bins in http://g.co/maps/p4nqr. Then follow the signs =]
