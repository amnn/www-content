    Over the past few years,
    <a href="http://php.net/" title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">
     PHP
    </a>
    has become the tool of choice for aspiring web developers everywhere — picked up and misused by millions. As a language that is easy to get started with, through examples and code snippets across the web, it is cut and pasted to death, leaving a legacy of unreadability and insecurity and a reputation as a 'bad' language.

    will discuss some of the pitfalls of PHP development and introduce a range of tools and techniques that can be used to transform a lacklustre PHP amateur into a polished professional. It will focus mainly on applying good design and testing to projects, and introduce some of the popular tools that will help developers to achieve clean, secure, maintainable code.
