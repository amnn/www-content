    The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is legislation enacted in response to the Enron and WorldCom financial scandals to protect shareholders and the general public from accounting errors and fraudulent practices in the enterprise. Ryan Loughins from Deloitte will explain the effects of SOX on the way we conduct business, as well as how embracing the "spirit of the law" - strong ethics, good governance, reliable reporting - will reap the benefits of a re-energized company and reassured investors.
