    <strong>
     Steven Audis
    </strong>
    from Microsoft UK will speak about Windows Vista, the highly successful XP's successor. He will give a demonstration of some of the most exciting technology (such as Avalon, WinFX and the new security features). If you're a Windows fan who wants to know what's in store, a Windows sufferer looking for things to get better, or a Windows evader wondering what you're missing, come along and find out what Vista will be capable of.
