  Come along and chat about HTML, DHTML, CSS or whatever else takes your fancy. From the dabbler to the web design expert, all are welcome. There will be machines available for running demonstrations or just trying things out for yourself. Meet outside the Nuclear and Astrophysics Laboratory (NAPL) on Keble Road.
