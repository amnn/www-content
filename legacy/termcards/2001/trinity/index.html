    Professor Dijkstra of the University of Texas at Austin will present his recollections of operating system design from about 1956 to 1966. He hopes for an audience young enough to remember little from those years!

    The first of a new style of Compsoc meeting, rather than a talk from a speaker this is an informal social. To give the meeting some focus we'll initially be playing around with some perl but the meeting will be shaped by the interests of whoever turns up.
   </p>
   <p>
    We're starting early and will be heading out for food at some point during the evening. Meet outside the Keble Road entrance to NAPL at 18:30.

    Well, you certainly missed out if you didn't make our social in 1st week, but fortunately you've got another chance!
   </p>
   <p>
    In the (possibly mythical) past Compsoc members have worked together to write (or at least talk about writing) world leading (right) programs. In keeping with this fine tradition come along to chat about computers, code, beer and maybe even get something together.

    Bringing together physics and computer science, MathEngine are a commercial company who produce a world-leading physics engine aimed at both the entertainment/game industry and engineering and academic modeling. Primarily specialising in collision detection with arbitrary meshes and articulated rigid body simulation, the MathEngine Karma toolkit has been used in a range of products, notably the PlayStation 2 game `Primal Image' where it was used to realistically model Yuki Terai, one of Japan's best known virtual celebrities.
   </p>
   <p>
    Several members of the MathEngine team will be speaking to Compsoc on a range of related topics including application development, the toolkit itself and considerations and optimizations involved in deployment on a console such as the PS2.

    Beer, burgers, sun (yeah right) and computers, it has to be the annual Compsoc barbeque.
   </p>
   <p>
    To reach Goodson Walk go north along South Parks Road past the science area. When the road turns right take the cycle path to Marston. At the second cattle grid continue straight on past the first road on the right. Turn right, then immediately left. Follow that road, ignoring the road on the right. At the end of the road take the small footpath and follow it for about 20m, then turn right after about 10m, then left into Goodson Walk.
   </p>
   <p>
    A group will be leaving Keble lodge at 6pm if you don't feel like braving the 15 minute walk to outer Oxford by yourself.
