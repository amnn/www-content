  Well, you certainly missed out if you didn't make our social in 1st week, but fortunately you've got another chance!

 <p>
  In the (possibly mythical) past Compsoc members have worked together to write (or at least talk about writing) world leading (right) programs. In keeping with this fine tradition come along to chat about computers, code, beer and maybe even get something together.
