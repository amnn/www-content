  11 Goodson Walk, Marston
 </p>
 <p>
  Beer, burgers, sun (yeah right) and computers, it has to be the annual Compsoc barbeque.
 </p>
 <p>
  To reach Goodson Walk go north along South Parks Road past the science area. When the road turns right take the cycle path to Marston. At the second cattle grid continue straight on past the first road on the right. Turn right, then immediately left. Follow that road, ignoring the road on the right. At the end of the road take the small footpath and follow it for about 20m, then turn right after about 10m, then left into Goodson Walk.

  A group will be leaving Keble lodge at 6pm if you don't feel like braving the 15 minute walk to outer Oxford by yourself.
