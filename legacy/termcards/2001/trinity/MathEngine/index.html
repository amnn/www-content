  Bringing together physics and computer science, MathEngine are a commercial company who produce a world-leading physics engine aimed at both the entertainment/game industry and engineering and academic modeling. Primarily specialising in collision detection with arbitrary meshes and articulated rigid body simulation, the MathEngine Karma toolkit has been used in a range of products, notably the PlayStation 2 game `Primal Image' where it was used to realistically model Yuki Terai, one of Japan's best known virtual celebrities.

  Several members of the MathEngine team will be speaking to Compsoc on a range of related topics including application development, the toolkit itself and considerations and optimizations involved in deployment on a console such as the PS2.
