  NAPL
 </p>
 <p>
  The first of a new style of Compsoc meeting, rather than a talk from a speaker this is an informal social. To give the meeting some focus we'll initially be playing around with some perl but the meeting will be shaped by the interests of whoever turns up.
 </p>
 <p>
  We're starting early and will be heading out for food at some point during the evening. Meet outside the Keble Road entrance to NAPL at 18:30.
