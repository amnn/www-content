    This event is sponsored by
    <a href="http://rebellion.co.uk/">
     Rebellion Games
    </a>
    , who are providing us with some games to play for free! As always, pizza and refreshments will be provided.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you are having trouble getting into the building on the night, call 01865 283599.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you plan on attending you will need to bring a laptop with any games you want to play
    <strong>
     installed and updated
    </strong>
    !
   </p>
   <p>
    You will also need a LAN cable and probably a power supply for your laptop.
   </p>
   <p>
    Team Fortess 2 and Super Monday Night Combat are both free to install and play from
    <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">
     store.steampowered.com/
    </a>
    (you have to install Steam first, though). It is also possible to install TF2 from another computer with it already installed on, we will probably be able to facilitate this but should stress that it is a much better idea to
    <strong>
     make sure it is installed and up to date beforehand!
    </strong>
    If there are any other games you'd like to play (and think others will have) bring them along and we might play them too!
