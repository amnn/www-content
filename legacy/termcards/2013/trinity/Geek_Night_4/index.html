  This week's geek night is a little special!
 </p>
 <p>
  CompSoc is having mini competition to see who can make the best Sevens playing program! This will happen during this Geek Night.
 </p>
 <p>
  At some point that evening submit to Greg a Java .class file which implements the following interface. Anything goes except reflection, returning invalid moves, or causing the simulation to hang! :P
