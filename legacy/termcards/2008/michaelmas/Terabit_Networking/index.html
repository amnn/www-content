  What sits behind the familiar Ethernet port or ADSL modem, that somehow
connects a planet exchanging over 350 petabytes a day? After a century
dominated by the telephone, all global networks today are changing to be

can cost millions of pounds, and require cutting-edge custom silicon,

  This talk is an accessible introduction to large-scale networking today,
from both real-world and computer science perspectives.
