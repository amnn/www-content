  The Big Bang
 </p>
 <p>
  The Termly General Meeting, the pinnacle of democracy. We'll go over the term, make sure everything is in order, check our Treasurer 
hasn't fled to a foreign country with CompSoc's fortune, and hopefully get it over with in a reasonably short amount of time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The TGM-slash-general-Christmas-social will be in the
  <a href="http://oxford.openguides.org/wiki/?Big_Bang">
   Big Bang
  </a>
  , which is near the bottom end of Jericho; see that Openguides link for details. Afterwards, we'll be following the finest CompSoc tradition and finding a pub.

 <p>
  New members should note that we hold the TGM between ordering the meal at the Big Bang, and eating it, and we often have plenty of time to spare, to show exactly how long these meetings are...
