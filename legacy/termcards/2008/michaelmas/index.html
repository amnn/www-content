    Somewhat of a CompSoc tradition, we'll be having a tour of OUCS' machine room, with several mostly-willing OUCS people on hand to show you around, answer questions, and suchlike.
   </p>
   <p>
    It's normally a great insight into the bowels of this most important of departments, and offers many great challenges (such as figuring out quite what their naming scheme is).
   </p>
   <p>
    Meet at the main OUCS entrance on Banbury Road for 17:30; there will be a sign up so you know you're at the right place.
   </p>
   <p>
    N.B. You must have a valid University Card with you in order to be admitted to the OUCS Building.

    The Oxford Geek Night isn't a Compsoc event, but is still worth attending;
the event consists of two 15 minute 'keynote' talks, followed by several
microslots (normally around 5 minutes each).
   </p>
   <p>
    The event runs at a reasonably relaxed pace, and there's plenty of chance to get
a drink from the upstairs bar (note that the whole event is upstairs - don't
get confused by the JT looking perfectly normal downstairs that day).
   </p>

    What sits behind the familiar Ethernet port or ADSL modem, that somehow
connects a planet exchanging over 350 petabytes a day? After a century
dominated by the telephone, all global networks today are changing to be
based on Internet-inspired technology. At their heart are devices that
can cost millions of pounds, and require cutting-edge custom silicon,
optics, and millions of lines of software.
   </p>
   <p>
    This talk is an accessible introduction to large-scale networking today,
from both real-world and computer science perspectives.
   </p>
   <p>
    The presenter is CTO of
    <a href="http://www.ensoft.co.uk/">

    , whose experience includes helping
bringing the Guinness Book of Records' "World's Highest Capacity

    The Big Bang

   <p>
    The Termly General Meeting, the pinnacle of democracy. We'll go over the term, make sure everything is in order, check our Treasurer 
hasn't fled to a foreign country with CompSoc's fortune, and hopefully get it over with in a reasonably short amount of time.

   <p>
    The TGM-slash-general-Christmas-social will be in the

    , which is near the bottom end of Jericho; see that Openguides link for details. Afterwards, we'll be following the finest CompSoc tradition and finding a pub.

   <p>
    New members should note that we hold the TGM between ordering the meal at the Big Bang, and eating it, and we often have plenty of time to spare, to show exactly how long these meetings are...
