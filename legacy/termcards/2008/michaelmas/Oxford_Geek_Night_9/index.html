  The Oxford Geek Night isn't a Compsoc event, but is still worth attending;
the event consists of two 15 minute 'keynote' talks, followed by several
microslots (normally around 5 minutes each).
 </p>
 <p>
  The event runs at a reasonably relaxed pace, and there's plenty of chance to get
a drink from the upstairs bar (note that the whole event is upstairs - don't
get confused by the JT looking perfectly normal downstairs that day).
