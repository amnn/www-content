    The Oxford Geek Night isn't a Compsoc event, but is still worth attending;
the event consists of two 15 minute 'keynote' talks, followed by several
microslots (normally around 5 minutes each).
   </p>
   <p>
    The event runs at a reasonably relaxed pace, and there's plenty of chance to get
a drink from the upstairs bar (note that the whole event is upstairs - don't
get confused by the JT looking perfectly normal downstairs that day).

    After the success of Michaelmas term's
    <a href="./../../2007/michaelmas/Lightning_Talks/">
     Lightning Talks
    </a>
    ,
we're back with the same format: one room, one projector, and many speakers,
each doing a short slot.
   </p>
   <p>
    Anyone is welcome to give a talk, or just have a good laugh watching the rest
of us screw up. If you'd be interested in giving a talk, contact the
    <a href="./../../../committee/">
     committee
    </a>
    - it doesn't necessarily need to be computer-related, just
interesting! We'll have a laptop and projector available, but you're welcome to
bring your own laptop if you prefer.
   </p>
   <p>
    There'll be someone at Keble lodge to take you to the room.
