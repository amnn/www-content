  After the success of Michaelmas term's
  <a href="./../../../2007/michaelmas/Lightning_Talks/">
   Lightning Talks
  </a>
  ,
we're back with the same format: one room, one projector, and many speakers,
each doing a short slot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Anyone is welcome to give a talk, or just have a good laugh watching the rest
of us screw up. If you'd be interested in giving a talk, contact the
  <a href="./../../../../committee/">
   committee
  </a>
  - it doesn't necessarily need to be computer-related, just
interesting! We'll have a laptop and projector available, but you're welcome to
bring your own laptop if you prefer.
 </p>
 <p>
  There'll be someone at Keble lodge to take you to the room.
