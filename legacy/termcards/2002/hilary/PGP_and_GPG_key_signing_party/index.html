  A potential weakness of the public key architecture is that it can be difficult to establish that a given public key actually belongs to whom it claims. In signing a key, you guarantee that you have verified it to be bona fide. The Compsoc key signing party provides just such an opportunity to sign other's keys and thereby build a so-called 'web of trust'. After the serious stuff is out of the way we shall be heading to the pub to emphasise the 'Party' aspect of the event!

  More details of how the event will be conducted are available
here. If you plan to come to the meeting,
please send your public key to pgp@ox.compsoc.net not later than 20:00 on
Monday 4th February. Please note that it will be necessary to bring
photographic ID and the details of your key with you.
