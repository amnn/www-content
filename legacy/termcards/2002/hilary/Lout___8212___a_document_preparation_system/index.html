  Many Compsoc members find it necessary to produce technical documents as part of their studies. Many feel these stretch the capabilities of traditional wordprocessors to breaking point, and so look for an alternative. The traditional solution is LaTeX, which can sometimes be so dominant that other systems get overlooked. In this talk we'll be taking a look at another possibility in the form of Lout, with a particular emphasis on producing project reports.
