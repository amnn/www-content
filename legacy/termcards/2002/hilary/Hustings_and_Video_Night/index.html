  Hilary term is when the Compsoc committee hand their roles over to three fresh-faced new recruits. If you are considering being on the committee for the coming year, this meeting will give you a chance to talk informally with the current committee about the responsibilities and rewards of committeeship. However, this evening is not solely for committee wanabees: we'll be showing a couple of famous vaguely computer based films, potentially including Hackers, Sneakers, Wargames and whatever else we can find.
