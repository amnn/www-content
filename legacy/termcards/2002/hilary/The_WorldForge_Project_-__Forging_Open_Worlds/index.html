  The WorldForge project aims to bring professional quality Open Source software to the games industry, an area still dominated by proprietary technology. The very fast pace of technological progress and the need for creative as well as technical expertise makes this industry very hard to break into. By developing reusable technology and open standards members have built a solid base for anyone seeking to develop Open Source games, but delivering a product while keeping up with the ever changing expectations of the gaming community has proved to be quite a challenge.

  Al Riddoch, a WorldForge developer, will be coming from Southampton to talk about the project.
