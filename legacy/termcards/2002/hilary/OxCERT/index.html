  Neil Long and Patrick Green from the Oxford Computer Emergency Response Team (OxCERT) will be giving a short talk about computer security issues before opening the floor for a general security discussion. So if you've ever wondered about the University's security policy or the risks and necessary precautions associated with having a machine on the Internet, this talk provides an ideal forum to get your questions answered.
