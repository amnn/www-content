  At the same event last year, grand plans were laid for the hotshot programmers of Compsoc to write a distributed appointments management system. At a subsequent social, a rather less ambitious attempt was made to turn the Compsoc termcard into XML to make it easier to convert to other formats (e.g. WML, or to sync to PDAs). Come along and do your bit to advance either or both of these projects, or just to have a chat and mess around with computers.
