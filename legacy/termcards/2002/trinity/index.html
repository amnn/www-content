    Stephen introduces programming in Python. Python is seen by many as a suitable alternative to Perl for system and CGI scripting; this talk will attempt to cover the features of Python that make it good for these purposes, as well as looking at other uses, such as its use as an embedded interpreter in other software.

    This will be a general introduction to server-side web programming. It will start with the ubiquitous CGI interface and various methods of programming to this interface, and go on to discuss other interfaces such as mod_perl, HTML::Mason, Embperl and Safeperl (as offered by Compsoc). We will also offer some advice on writing secure scripts.
   </p>
   <p>
    Whilst the main focus will be Perl under UNIX-like operating systems, there will be a possibility of covering other languages (e.g. PHP) and interfaces (e.g. ASP), as well as database backends.

    Evolving Humans for Games and Films - Real-time neural control of physically simulated characters.
   </p>
   <p>
    The producers of both action films and 3D computer games are now beginning to realise the potential of physical simulation technology for their titles. It saves them time, enhances realism and increases interactivity. However, only with the appropriate AI techniques to control these physical simulations, can these scenes be brought to life.
   </p>
   <p>
    Colm Massey, co-founder of NaturalMotion Ltd., an Oxford University spin-off, explains how they are applying biologically inspired control and optimisation techniques to simulated humans for games and movies.

    Linux distributions such as Redhat and Debian make your life easier by compiling software and distributing it in a common format to work together with packages from the same distribution. The ideal way to install a piece of software that doesn't come with the distribution is to package it up in the same way so that it can be easily removed, upgraded, or installed on another machine. This talk will be an introduction to doing this for the two most common Linux packaging formats, RPM and DEB. It's easier than you think!

    This talk will present the latest and greatest, smaller, faster, more beautiful Gnome 2.0 desktop environment, and explain why this is going to be the platform of choice for Unix Vendors and ISVs for the next 5 years. You will catch a glimpse of the power of the new environment, and the (fading) glory of the exciting things still happening on top of the Gnome 1.4 platform. You should come away inspired with the vision of an accessible Free software desktop.

    At the same event last year, grand plans were laid for the hotshot programmers of Compsoc to write a distributed appointments management system. At a subsequent social, a rather less ambitious attempt was made to turn the Compsoc termcard into XML to make it easier to convert to other formats (e.g. WML, or to sync to PDAs). Come along and do your bit to advance either or both of these projects, or just to have a chat and mess around with computers.
