  Evolving Humans for Games and Films - Real-time neural control of physically simulated characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  The producers of both action films and 3D computer games are now beginning to realise the potential of physical simulation technology for their titles. It saves them time, enhances realism and increases interactivity. However, only with the appropriate AI techniques to control these physical simulations, can these scenes be brought to life.

  Colm Massey, co-founder of NaturalMotion Ltd., an Oxford University spin-off, explains how they are applying biologically inspired control and optimisation techniques to simulated humans for games and movies.
