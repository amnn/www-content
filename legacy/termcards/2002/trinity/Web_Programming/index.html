  This will be a general introduction to server-side web programming. It will start with the ubiquitous CGI interface and various methods of programming to this interface, and go on to discuss other interfaces such as mod_perl, HTML::Mason, Embperl and Safeperl (as offered by Compsoc). We will also offer some advice on writing secure scripts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whilst the main focus will be Perl under UNIX-like operating systems, there will be a possibility of covering other languages (e.g. PHP) and interfaces (e.g. ASP), as well as database backends.
