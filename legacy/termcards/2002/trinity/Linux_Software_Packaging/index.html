  Linux distributions such as Redhat and Debian make your life easier by compiling software and distributing it in a common format to work together with packages from the same distribution. The ideal way to install a piece of software that doesn't come with the distribution is to package it up in the same way so that it can be easily removed, upgraded, or installed on another machine. This talk will be an introduction to doing this for the two most common Linux packaging formats, RPM and DEB. It's easier than you think!
