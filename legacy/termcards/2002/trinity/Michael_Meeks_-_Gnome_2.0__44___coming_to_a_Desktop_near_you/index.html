  This talk will present the latest and greatest, smaller, faster, more beautiful Gnome 2.0 desktop environment, and explain why this is going to be the platform of choice for Unix Vendors and ISVs for the next 5 years. You will catch a glimpse of the power of the new environment, and the (fading) glory of the exciting things still happening on top of the Gnome 1.4 platform. You should come away inspired with the vision of an accessible Free software desktop.
