  In the last ten years Open Source software has come from being an 'interesting' plaything for hobbyists and geeks into the mainstream of business computing. The success of Open Source has been built on the rock solid components of the Linux operating system, the Apache web server, the MySQL database, and a scripting language whose name starts with 'P' - Perl, PHP or Python, depending on your religion. These components are commonly known by the acronym LAMP. This talk will look at the LAMP components, as well as Linux distributions and some of the strengths and weaknesses of Open Source software, and strategies for deploying it in business. The talk will also attempt to strip away some of the myths surrounding Open Source software - myths pushed both by fanatical supporters, and by equally fanatical opponents.
