  The e-Government Unit works with government departments to deliver efficiency savings while improving the delivery of public services by joining up electronic government services around the needs of customers (that's us as UK citizens!). Government IT projects traditionally have a poor reputation, so come along to find out what the unit is doing to try and improve things. Mark Gladwyn, Director of Infrastructure Services, will be telling us about the work of the unit and the massive challenges faced in public sector IT.
