    Forget bar codes - RFID is the future! By embedding tiny radio transmitters into all of our everyday items, we can be tracked like never before. This technology will help reduce theft and fraud, improve public safety and provide much better management reporting. Like all new technology it can be a force for good or misuse. What impact does this have for Civil Liberties?
