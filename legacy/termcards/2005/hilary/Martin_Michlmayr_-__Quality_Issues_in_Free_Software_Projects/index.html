  The nature of open source software means that it faces unique quality-control issues. Martin will give an overview of common quality issues found in both large and small free software projects, and discuss strategies and techniques which can be implemented in a free software project to ensure quality and to maintain a stable quality process. Martin Michlmayr is the current Debian (Linux) Project Leader and has been involved in various free software projects for about 10 years.
