 <p>
  Due to the only event this week being the deloitte dinner, and with the restrictions placed on the number going and those who could RSVP, we've decided to hold another event this week (as mentioned previously in the email)
 </p>
 <p>
  The film night will be in the same place as last time, St. Catherine's College JCR Lecture Theatre. And as last time, none of the films rented by CompSoc were chosen, instead we invite you to bring your own films, and we can do a vote on the night.
 </p>
 <p>
  Feel free to discuss movies below.
 </p>
 <p>
  See you all on the night!
