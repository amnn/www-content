  Break a Hacker’s Mind: Web Application Vulnerabilities Exposed...
 </p>
 <p>
  Join us for an interactive session with the IT Security group at Morgan Stanley: “Break a Hacker’s Mind: Web Application Vulnerabilities Exposed...”. Together we will work through a web application the group has created which is riddled with the common issues through which banking applications can be compromised. We use this application internally to demonstrate to our development community how an attacker would exploit web vulnerabilities and to explain remediation strategies. We have also delivered this talk at industry forums, universities and even the House of Lords. Charles Clarke (Lincoln, 2007) and Aldwin Saugere (former penetration tester, now a Security Architect) will lead this session. Pizzas will be served!
