    Break a Hacker’s Mind: Web Application Vulnerabilities Exposed...
   </p>
   <p>
    Join us for an interactive session with the IT Security group at Morgan Stanley: “Break a Hacker’s Mind: Web Application Vulnerabilities Exposed...”. Together we will work through a web application the group has created which is riddled with the common issues through which banking applications can be compromised. We use this application internally to demonstrate to our development community how an attacker would exploit web vulnerabilities and to explain remediation strategies. We have also delivered this talk at industry forums, universities and even the House of Lords. Charles Clarke (Lincoln, 2007) and Aldwin Saugere (former penetration tester, now a Security Architect) will lead this session. Pizzas will be served!
   </p>
   <p>
    At Morgan Stanley, solving complex challenges and fuelling economic growth across continents is what we do. We offer you a structured path to success, providing you with the training, mobility and responsibility to make a real difference.

    Phishing, hacking and Internet based fraud are growing very quickly, not only in absolute numbers, but also in diversity and complexity. We review contemporary Internet bank robbing, illustrating the scale of the activity, the technological arms race between attackers and defenders, some recent innovations, and mistakes from each side.

    Netcraft will be giving a talk on some of the dangers of the internet.

    Due to the only event this week being the deloitte dinner, and with the restrictions placed on the number going and those who could RSVP, we've decided to hold another event this week (as mentioned previously in the email)
   </p>
   <p>
    The film night will be in the same place as last time, St. Catherine's College JCR Lecture Theatre. And as last time, none of the films rented by CompSoc were chosen, instead we invite you to bring your own films, and we can do a vote on the night.
   </p>
   <p>
    Feel free to discuss movies below.

    See you all on the night!

     NB:
    </strong>
    The date has changed, it will be on Tuesday not Wednesday due to booking constraints.
   </p>
   <p>
    Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BoAML) Technology are sponsoring a LAN Party this term, think everything from Team Fortress 2 to Age of Empires, Dota to Starcraft, Unreal Tournaent to Super Moday Night Combat (and many other multiplayer games, open to suggestions). Once again, pizza and refreshments will be provided, and BoAML will be available to talk to as well.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Event will start with a small presentation from BoAML Technology (Around 7pm) including a Q&amp;A Session, Networking and information about a competition to win an iPad 3. There will be people there to answer your questions regarding BoAML for the entire event.
   </p>
   <p>
    Pizza and Drinks will be there.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you plan on attending you will need to bring a laptop with any games you want to play installed and updated - Catz internet will be too slow to download stuff.
   </p>
   <p>
    You will also need a LAN cable and probably a power supply for your laptop.
   </p>
   <p>
    Team Fortess 2 and Super Monday Night Combat are both free to install and play from
    <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">
     http://store.steampowered.com/
    </a>
    (you have to install Steam first, though). It is also possible to install TF2 from another computer with it already installed on, we will probably be able to facilitate this but should stress that it is a much better idea to make sure it is installed and up to date beforehand. If there are any other games you'd like to play (and think others will have) bring them along and we might play them too!

Nick will give 3 real examples of practical problems that have come up for him as a Googler, and how we try to engineer them to give the best possible result for every user. Oh, and a few ridiculously big numbers, and a bit about Google's amazing work environment :-)
