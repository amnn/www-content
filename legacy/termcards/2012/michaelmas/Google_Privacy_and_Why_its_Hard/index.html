  Abstract: Google engineers are striving every day to do what's best for the user, and often it is hard. Nick will give 3 real examples of practical problems that have come up for him as a Googler, and how we try to engineer them to give the best possible result for every user. Oh, and a few ridiculously big numbers, and a bit about Google's amazing work environment :-)
