  This week we have a film night lined up at St Catz JCR lecture theatre. Come along on Wednesday to get free pizza, drinks and enjoy a (hopefully good) film. Whether or not the film is good is in your hands, as there is a poll up to decide on the film. As always there will be interesting discussion to be had regarding computers afterwards.
