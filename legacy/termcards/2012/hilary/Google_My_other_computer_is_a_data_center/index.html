  Google's mission, to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful, is simple, but it entails running a large number of very different applications from web search and advertising over video, geo and commerce to enterprise.  All these activities are supported by a single underlying computing infrastructure: Google's worldwide data centers.

  In this talk, I will try to give an impressions how it is to work at Google directly which such a unique infrastructure, and what its implications for computer science could be, with an emphasis on large-scale data processing.

  Google have kindly offered to provide free drinks afterwards. They have also provided us with some Google T-Shirts to give away!
