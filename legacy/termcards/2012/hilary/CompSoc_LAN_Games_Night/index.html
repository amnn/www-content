  We will be running a Team Fortress 2 night (or perhaps other games - make a suggestion!) in St Catz PDR. There will be free pizza and jaffa cakes!
 </p>
 <p>
  If you plan on attending you will need to bring a laptop with Team Fortress 2 installed and up to date - please don't try and download it in Catz as it will be really slow :-(
You will also need a LAN cable and probably a power supply for your laptop.
 </p>
 <p>
  Team Fortress 2 can be downloaded, installed and played for free
  <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/440">
   here
  </a>
  (you'll need to install Steam, which is also free). If there are any other games you'd like to play (and think others will have) bring them along and we might play them too! (here's hoping for Minecraft... :-p  )
 </p>

  Here is a handy map for finding Catz:

  The Arumugan building is the fancy name of the lodge, we will be in the room just to the left after you go up the stairs.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you get truly lost in Catz, you can call Ben on 0754 999 3401. Someone should be at the lodge to show you where to go between 1900 and 1915.
