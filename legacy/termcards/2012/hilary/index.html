    Christoph Best, Software Engineer, Google
   </p>
   <p>
    Google's mission, to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful, is simple, but it entails running a large number of very different applications from web search and advertising over video, geo and commerce to enterprise.  All these activities are supported by a single underlying computing infrastructure: Google's worldwide data centers.
   </p>
   <p>
    In this talk, I will try to give an impressions how it is to work at Google directly which such a unique infrastructure, and what its implications for computer science could be, with an emphasis on large-scale data processing.
   </p>
   <p>
    Google have kindly offered to provide free drinks afterwards. They have also provided us with some Google T-Shirts to give away!

    We will be running a Team Fortress 2 night (or perhaps other games - make a suggestion!) in St Catz PDR. There will be free pizza and jaffa cakes!
   </p>
   <p>
    If you plan on attending you will need to bring a laptop with Team Fortress 2 installed and up to date - please don't try and download it in Catz as it will be really slow :-(
You will also need a LAN cable and probably a power supply for your laptop.
   </p>
   <p>
    Team Fortress 2 can be downloaded, installed and played for free
    <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/440">
     here
    </a>
    (you'll need to install Steam, which is also free). If there are any other games you'd like to play (and think others will have) bring them along and we might play them too! (here's hoping for Minecraft... :-p  )
