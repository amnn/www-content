  About Compsoc
 </h1>
 <p>
  The Oxford University Computer Society (CompSoc) exists to promote the use of
IT, computers and the internet and to organise meetings for members to further
our computing interests.  Meetings often include talks by invited guest speakers
as well as practical courses run by Compsoc members on fields in which they are
particularly interested.  We also hold a variety of social events including Film
Nights, Gaming (LAN) Parties, and weekly "Geek Nights". For more information on 
our activities, you can take a look at our
