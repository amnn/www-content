  Quorn (formerly Clippy) is a Dell Pentium 4 tower server running Windows Server 2003,
and was donated to the society by
  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">
   Microsoft
  </a>
  in the early 2000s.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is currently on long-term loan to
  <a href="./../../../people/David_North/">
   David North
  </a>
  until the
society can find a new SysAdmin Co-ordinator and some hosting for it.
