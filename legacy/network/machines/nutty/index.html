  Nutty was originally a fast x86 box running Windows NT and

  . However, the fast hardware
was moved to a different machine.

 <p>
  Nutty is now our FreeBSD machine. It's a Pentium 75 with 32 MB of RAM (some donated by a member as a result of hardware failures in February 2000). It is currently out of commission.
