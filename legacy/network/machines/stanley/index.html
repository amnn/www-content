  Stanley was currently running on an old version of
  <a href="http://the.earth.li/">
   the.earth.li
  </a>
  .  It
was donated in Summer 2007, when the.earth.li was upgraded.  It's a 1GHz PIII,
with 2GB RAM, 4 18GB SCSI and 1 250GB IDE drives.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was currently hosted by
  <a href="http://www.community.net.uk/">
   CI-Net
  </a>
  (or "Community Internet", as they were then) in their office in
Kidlington.  It provided primary DNS for CompSoc and provided us with a base
outside the limitations of the Oxford academic network, and also ran
  <a href="http://www.oxlug.org/">
   OxLUG's
  </a>
  mailing lists.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, in late November 2010, CI-Net moved offices, and stanley could
not go with them.  As there were very few sysadmins remaining, the society
opted to replace both it and
  <a href="./../salami/">
   Salami
  </a>
  with a single VM,
  <a href="./../ice/">
   Ice
  </a>
  , rather than
trying to find new hosting.

  The original stanley
 </h2>
 <p>
  Stanley was donated to Compsoc by the
  <a href="http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/">
   Department of Astrophysics
  </a>
  in
Hilary Term 2005. It's a dual 1 GHz PIII with 1GB of RAM and 2x18GB SCA disks. 
It was originally a cluster node as part of the 64-node Linux beowulf cluster
'glamdring' used for Theoretical Astrophysics simulations.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was replaced in Trinity Term 2007 by old
  <a href="http://urchin.earth.li/">
   urchin.earth.li
  </a>
  hardware, which
was kindly loaned to CompSoc.  Old-urchin was a 700 MHz PIII with 1GB RAM and 2
120GB IDE drives.
