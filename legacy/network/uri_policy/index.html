 <h2>
  Objectives
 </h2>
 <ol>
  <li>
   The URI for a resource should, as far as possible, never change.
  </li>
  <li>
   URIs should be easy to infer, and 'clean'.
  </li>
  <li>
   URIs should be chosen to avoid tying unrelated services to the same hostname.
  </li>
  <li>
   Each resource should have only one URI.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <h2>
  Rules
 </h2>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Do not chose URIs with machine names in them. This makes it difficult to move services between machines and violates 1, 2 and 3.
  </li>
  <li>
   URIs beginning www.ox.compsoc.net should be for resources which are part of the CompSoc website. Do
   <em>
    not
   </em>
   add random stuff under www, find a proper place for it (see below).
  </li>
  <li>
   Do not be afraid to invent a new hostname under ox.compsoc.net if your resource does not logically fit under any of the existing ones.
  </li>
  <li>
   URIs for web user directories (e.g. users.ox.compsoc.net/~username/) should be on the host 'users.ox.compsoc.net' for current students, and 'alumni.ox.compsoc.net' for alumni. They should
   <em>
    not
   </em>
   be under www.ox.compsoc.net.
  </li>
  <li>
   When configuring web servers, please make sure URL paths do
   <em>
    not
   </em>
   accidentally work under multiple hostnames, as this violates objectives 3 and 4.
  </li>
  <li>
   URIs for SVN repositories should use the HTTPS protocol,
   <em>
    not
   </em>
   svn+ssh or file. This avoids file permissions becoming messy (see
   <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.serverconfig.choosing.html">
    here
   </a>
   ).
  </li>
  <li>
   Please consult the
   <a href="./../system_administrators/">
    sysadmin team
   </a>
   before making major changes or introducing a significant new family of URIs.
  </li>
 </ol>
