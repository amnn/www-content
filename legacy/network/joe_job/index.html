 <p>
  The compsoc.net domain is owned and operated by Oxford Computer
Society.  As a society we have no reason to send spam, nor would we tolerate
our users doing so, and being based primarily on an academic network we would
suffer the severe wrath of the University were we to do so.  Furthermore as a
society of computer enthusiasts we all suffer from our own mailboxes being
clogged with spam - often hundreds a day - and wouldn't wish that on anyone
else.
 </p>
 <p>
  So why did you get spam claiming to be from us?  It is notoriously easy to
forge the 'sender' address in an email, and make it look like it came from
someone other than the real sender.  Spammers know this, and realise that if
they were to use their own email addresses they would risk having their
accounts closed or internet connection terminated, while also making it easier
for law enforcement or 'anti-spam' activists to track them down.  In addition
when a spammer sends out tens of millions of emails a day they don't want to
provide the resources to deal with all the 'delivery' failed messages (bounces)
that inevitably result from their spam run.
 </p>
 <p>
  For these reasons a large amount of spam is sent out with faked sender
information.  To make the spam seem more legitimate to email handling software
spammers choose to fake the domains of real organisations.  Compsoc, like many
others on the Internet, has become one of the organisations to have its domain
used by spammers in this way.  This practise is very common, and is referred to
as a
  <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/J/joe-job.html" title="Eric S. Raymond's Jargon File">
   'joe-job'
  </a>
  : "A spam run forged to appear as though it came
from an innocent party, who is then generally flooded by the bounces".
 </p>
 <p>
  If you want to know who really sent you the spam then you (or your local guru)
can find more information from the 'Received' headers in the email.  You will
almost certainly find that the real sender was either hiding behind an
anonymous modem in a remote country, or that they were using someone else's
machine that they had broken into illegally.
