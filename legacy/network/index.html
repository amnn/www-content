 <h1>
  The Compsoc Network
 </h1>
 <p>
  At various times in the past, Compsoc has run a network of machines accessible
by members. Currently we have just
  <a href="./machines/">
   one machine
  </a>
  , 
providing basic web and email services to the society. 
All the society's machines are looked after by our team of
  <a href="./system_administrators/">
   System Administrators
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  You can obtain a copy of the sysadmin team's
  <a href="./../news/New_Support_GPG_Key/">
   GPG key
  </a>
  ,
and the
  <a href="./ca/">
   CompSoc Certificate Authority root certificate
  </a>
  from here.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those running websites on CompSoc servers should be aware of our
  <a href="./uri_policy/">
   URI Policy
  </a>

 <p>
  Thanks to the
  <a href="http://www.man.compsoc.org.uk/">
   Manchester University Computer Society
  </a>
  , when the network
was first set up in 1995 we were able to use the
  <code>
   ox.compsoc.org.uk
  </code>
  domain.
However, various technical and aesthetic reasons persuaded us to register our
own domain,
  <code>
   compsoc.net
  </code>
  . We provide our own primary DNS, but secondary
nameserving is provided by a variety of sources â€” see our
  <a href="./../sponsors/">
   sponsors
  </a>
  page
for details of companies who have helped us in this respect.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as we benefited from Manchester's generosity with the
  <code>
   compsoc.org.uk
  </code>
  domain, we are willing to help out other societies who would like subdomains
within
  <code>
   compsoc.net
  </code>
  . If you're interested, please
  <a href="mailto:committee@ox.compsoc.net">
   contact
  </a>
  the
  <a href="./../committee/">
   committee
  </a>
  and we'll see if we can provide what you're looking for.
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, the following organisations have subdomains within the
  <code>
   compsoc.net
  </code>
  domain name:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.galway.compsoc.net/">
    Student Services Website, NUI, Galway
   </a>
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.unsw.compsoc.net">
    UNSW Compsoc
   </a>
  </li>
 </ul>
