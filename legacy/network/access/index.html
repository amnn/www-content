  Accessing the Compsoc Network
 </h1>
 <p>
  <em>
   Please note
  </em>
  as of December 2010, we have no servers that allow access to
general society members.  Thus, the information below is provided for reference
only.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are a variety of methods by which you can access your account and mail on
the Compsoc network. These include SSH for logging in, POP3 for mail retrieval
and SFTP for file transfer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please note that no plaintext services are now offered by Compsoc. please see
the
  <a href="#ssh">
   section on SSH
  </a>
  for more details on how to access Compsoc securely
in for a variety of purposes.  Additionally, SSL IMAP4 and POP3 services are now
supported.
 </p>
 <p>
  You should ssh to the machine on which you have been given an account —
either stanley or salami.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is good practice to verify the host key fingerprints when you connect from a
new machine. To help in doing this, they have been provided

  Many common methods by which you may wish to access your account on the Compsoc
network (or elsewhere) — including telnet, POP3, FTP and more — exchange data
in plain (that is, non-encrypted) text. It's relatively easy for nefarious
persons to grab your plain text password (or other potentially confidential
information) from the network as it flashes by.
 </p>
 <p>
  SSH encrypts all the data it sends over the network, including your password.
For this reason, we recommend you use SSH for logging in to the Compsoc network
and SCP — a file transfer program which is part of the SSH family — for file
transfers. It's also possible to use SSH to encrypt mail transfers using a
technique called "port forwarding" — see the SSH documentation for details.

 <p>
  SSH clients are available for most operating systems. Linux and BSD
distributions usually provide one — often
  <a href="http://www.openssh.com/">
   OpenSSH
  </a>
  , which originated in
the
  <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">
   OpenBSD
  </a>
  project. To connect to the Compsoc network from a Linux
machine, run:
 </p>
 <pre><code>$ ssh username@machinename.ox.compsoc.net
</code></pre>
 <p>
  replacing machinename by the desired choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  A variety of SSH clients are available for Microsoft Windows.
  <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">
   PuTTY
  </a>
  is an
excellent basic client. It does not implement some of the more complex features
of other SSH clients, but it's more than adequate for simple terminal
connections. And it's free.

  Mail still requires some setup. Details will appear here when they are sorted.
