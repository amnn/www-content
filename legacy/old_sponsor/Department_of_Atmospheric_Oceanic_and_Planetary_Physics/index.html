  In a clear-out of parts, the
  <a href="http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/">
   Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary
Physics
  </a>
  allowed a group of mad Compsoc members to pillage a room of old
computer equipment. In the two car loads removed there are a lot of parts which
might have got into use by our members if not the Society.
