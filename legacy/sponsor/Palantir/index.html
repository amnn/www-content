  Palantir Technologies builds software platforms that help human experts perform powerful, collaborative analysis of data at scale. Palantirâ€™s software is deployed at public institutions, private enterprises, and in the non-profit sector to address the challenges of responsibly making sense of complex and diverse data.

 <p>
  We solve the technical problems, so they can solve the human ones. Combating terrorism. Tracking disease outbreaks. Finding missing and exploited children. We believe that with the right technology and enough data, people can still solve hard problems and change the world for the better.
