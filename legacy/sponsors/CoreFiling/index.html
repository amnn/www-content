  History
 </h2>
 <p>
  Mike Mason — a former CompSoc secretary — went to work at DecisionSoft (as it was
then called) over the Christmas vacation 1997, during which time he was developing
systems using Cold Fusion. When he left to return to college, the management at 
DecisionSoft decided a good way to access the talented student programmer population 
of Oxford University would be to foster links with the computer society.
 </p>
 <p>
  DecisionSoft needed people with Cold Fusion experience, and the best way to do
this was to get CompSoc people using it themselves, for their own web pages.
Cold Fusion was only available on the NT and Solaris platforms, so DecisionSoft
funded a whole new machine, Nutty, for running Cold Fusion. Key players in the
liason between CompSoc and DecisionSoft were Andrew Jackson and John Ireland
(then President and Secretary, respectively). Philip Allen (managing director
of DecisionSoft) also persuaded Allaire Corp., the company behind Cold Fusion,
to donate a copy of their $1,000 server software to us.
 </p>
 <p>
  DecisionSoft have since stopped developing with Cold Fusion, and are now
devoloping XML processing tools. They still continue to support CompSoc, and
several members have been employed by them, on temporary or permanent bases.
 </p>
 <p>
  DecisionSoft was renamed to CoreFiling in August 2009.

  Donation
 </h2>
 <p>
  CoreFiling donated a a new machine, a Cyrix P200+ M2 with 64MB RAM and a
3.2GB hard drive, to run Windows NT and ColdFusion. This machine has since been
swapped with another and served time as the main user box before being replaced
by a Sun UltraSparc.
