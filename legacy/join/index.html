 <h2>
  Associate Membership
 </h2>
 <p>
  We also have a limited number of (1 year) associate memberships available for
those who are not matriculated members of the University.  Associate members may
not be elected to the committee or vote at general meetings, and are granted at
the discretion of the committee.  Currently, the membership fee for associate
membership is the same as that for ordinary (1 year) membership.
