 <h2>
  History
 </h2>
 <p>
  Warburg Dillon Read is the investment banking division of UBS AG,
and one of the most successful investment banks in the world.
Their initial contact with Compsoc was at a recruitment
presentation in Michaelmas of 1998. Ex-President
  <a href="/~timothy/">
   Tim Needham
  </a>
  met with the party sent by
WDR.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two of them, Roz Allibone and Mat Ellis, expressed an interest on
behalf of the bank in forming a long term relationship with the
society —  they were interested in sponsorship of events,
donation of equipment and so on.
 </p>
 <h2>
  Big Brother
 </h2>
 <p>
  During Hilary term of 1999 they visited several events in order to
get a feel for the general tone of society talks. Then later on in
the term they presented a talk entitled "Big Brother" about
increasing infringements on personal freedoms and civil liberties,
focusing on data mining, the spread of CCTV, the amount of data
stored about an individual etc. The talk was a great success.
 </p>
 <h2>
  A Donation
 </h2>
 <p>
  WDR had some equipment which they were decommissioning, and Roz
and Mat suggested that Compsoc might benefit from it. So we
arranged to meet, hold a presentation and then have a celebratory
meal. When they arrived we were more than surprised - and
delighted - by the sheer amount and specification of the
equipment they donated.

 <h2>
  Plans
 </h2>
 <p>
  The following were our plans for the hardware at the time of the
donation.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are big plans for the new hardware. The 256 Mb UltraSparc will
run Linux and possibly become the main user box for our network,
the 128Mb Sparc is going to run Solaris and, if we can get a copy,
the HP will run HP/UX. All of which provides a fantastic wealth of
opportunities to both our members and our Sysadmin Team to get to
grips with using and administering systems that would not
otherwise be available to them.
