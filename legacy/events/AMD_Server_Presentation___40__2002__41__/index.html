  New SAC for 2002 Dominic Hargreaves takes the control of the server for the
Society.
 </p>
 <p>
  The machine donated to the society is based on an AMD Thunderbird 1.4 GHz
processor and included an IBM 60GXP 40 GB IDE hard disk.
 </p>
 <p>
  Compsoc intends to use the machine as the webserver for the compsoc.net site
and as the main user shell machine.
