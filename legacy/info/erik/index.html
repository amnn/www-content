 <h1>
  Erik's sabbatical
 </h1>
 <h2>
  Compsoc regional headquarters, 1:55am, 8/7/03
 </h2>
 <p>
  Compsoc is pleased to announce that Erik, the
  <a href="http://www.ousgg.org.uk/">
   OUSGG
  </a>
  panda, has been granted honorary
associate membership of Compsoc and will be taking a sabbatical with
Compsoc, effective immediately, to pursue his interest in computers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Erik said:
 </p>
 <p>
  "I would first like to express my gratitude to Compsoc for their generous
hospitality, and for the personal risks taken by two of their operatives
to enable me to take this sabbatical.
 </p>
 <p>
  "My interest in computers was stimulated some years ago by overhearing
many conversations at N'n'N and other OUSGG meetings. I was very
disappointed when OUSGG passed a motion discriminating against this hobby
and against Compsoc, and I would like to let it be known that I do not
intend to return until this motion is repealed and an apology is made to
Compsoc.
 </p>
 <p>
  "I would like to assure all those who are concerned about my welfare that
I am being well looked after and that my new accommodation is very
comfortable.
 </p>
 <p>
  "Finally, I would like to let it be known that I have become bored with
the traditional reversal of the last letter of my name, and that
henceforth I would like to be known simply as 'Erik'Â ".
