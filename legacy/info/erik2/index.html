 <h1>
  Erik's sabbatical
 </h1>

 <p>
  In response to a heartfelt appeal by OUSGG members, Erik has decided
to cut his sabbatical short and return to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Erik said:
 </p>
 <p>
  "I hope that this show of good faith will help relations between the
two societies".
 </p>
 <p>
  We remain hopeful that OUSGG will respond in kind by repealing the
offending motion at the next opportunity.
