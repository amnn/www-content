  This year we are starting a new series of events. Each weekend we will be hosting a geek/coding/pizza-eating night in the Undergraduate Social Area in the Computer Science Department. The idea is that we can group up and do coding projects/hackathons in a chilled environment while eating more pizza than is good for us. So come down and relax whether you would like to join in in projects or just chat.
