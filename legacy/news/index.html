  <p>
   Recently an
   <a href="./../minutes/Extraordinary_General_Meeting__44___Trinity_2011/">
    EGM
   </a>
   was called to elect a new committee following a period of inactivity for the society - I am writing as co-president of the successfully elected committee to introduce myself and the rest of us.
  </p>
  <p>
   We are all 2nd year Computer Scientists, and have formed the committee as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Co-Presidents - Alex Kavvos (Univ) and Ben Gazzard (St Catz)
   </li>
   <li>
    Secretary - Ian Jones (Balliol)
   </li>
   <li>
    Treasurer - Laurens Lemaire (St Catz)
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Together we hope to rebuild the society and will be making considerable effort to attract members across many academic years as active membership has likely dwindled. Currently we do not have any plans to organise any specific events this term. Instead we aim to focus on:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Building a fantastic term card for Michaelmas 2011
   </li>
   <li>
    Building links with the comlab for access to lecture halls
   </li>
   <li>
    Seeking sponsorship/external funding to potentially lower membership costs/subsidise events
   </li>
   <li>
    Assess the types of events run by other Computer Societies at other universities to offer a diverse range of activities
   </li>
   <li>
    Devising more 'hands on' type events
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   We are eager to hear any thoughts on the above or any suggestions you have. It would be great to find that we still have some active student members supporting the society.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, we hope to hold a TGM at the end of 7th week - with the plan to report on our plans in more detail then. More details about that will be sent closer to the time though.
  </p>
  <p>
   Best regards,
  </p>
  <p>

   Since the last update, there's not much to report. Towards the end of last
summer there was some interest in starting up the society again, but
unfortunately this didn't work out. It's now nearly a year since the
society has been with a committee, and it seems every more unlikely that
we will become active again, although we are still interested in hearing
from students who would like to play a role in this!
  </p>
  <p>
   The two servers formerly hosted at Worcester College and at CI-Net have
been decommissioned in favour of a single VM hosted by a society member;
this is providing basic web hosting and mail forwarding, and not much else
(if you had an account on the old servers we will have tried to contact you
at the time).

  <p>
   As of the AGM in Hilary term this year, Compsoc has been
unable to elect a committee due to lack of candidates, and so formal
operation of the society has been suspended.
  </p>
  <p>
   This means that unless someone steps up, there will not be a presence
at this year's Freshers' Fair, and not much chance of a termcard or
any other events next academic year. It also means that we can't
realistically accept any new members.
  </p>
  <p>
   We are no longer registered with the University Clubs' committee and,
amongst other things, this means that we are no longer called Oxford
University Computer Society but just Oxford Computer Society.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's not yet clear for how long the society can remain in this state,
neither fully operational nor having been dissolved, but it would not
make sense for it to stay this way for more than a couple of terms.
  </p>
  <p>
   I would like to once again urge any student of Oxford University
who has an interest
in the continued existence of the society to get in touch as soon as
possible so that an interim committee who can provide a Freshers' Fair
presence and one or two events for next term can be formed. Hopefully
we would then hold an EGM next term to elect a normal committee.
  </p>
  <p>
   Note that for the time being, the services provided by the Compsoc
network remain unaltered. However, if the society is not restarted within
a few terms it is very likely that some, if not all services, would have
to be withdrawn. The currently acting sysadmins can be contacted at the
usual address. It is highly desirable that a new committee be able to
co-opt a new Systems Administration Coordinator (SAC) as soon as possible,
in order to ensure that the network remains viable.

   which is currently composed of some members
who are best placed to assist in the reformation of the committee
proper (recently-ex committee members).
