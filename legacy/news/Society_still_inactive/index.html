  Since the last update, there's not much to report. Towards the end of last
summer there was some interest in starting up the society again, but
unfortunately this didn't work out. It's now nearly a year since the
society has been with a committee, and it seems every more unlikely that
we will become active again, although we are still interested in hearing
from students who would like to play a role in this!

  The two servers formerly hosted at Worcester College and at CI-Net have
been decommissioned in favour of a single VM hosted by a society member;
this is providing basic web hosting and mail forwarding, and not much else
(if you had an account on the old servers we will have tried to contact you
at the time).
