  At the
AMD talk, we
were very kindly donated a
  <a href="./../../network/machines/jessica/">
   new computer
  </a>
  by
  <a href="http://www.amd.com">
   AMD
  </a>
  , to replace
  <a href="./../../network/machines/scooby/">
   scooby
  </a>
  , which died just before
Christmas 2006.  This is being used to run
  <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/xen/">
   Xen
