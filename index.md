Welcome to the website of the Oxford University Computer Society (CompSoc).
We're here to promote the use of computers throughout the university, to
organise meetings and talks on computing-related subjects, and to generally do
things of a computer-related nature.

Here you can find information about upcoming events, about the society itself,
and how you can get involved.
